      "value" : "A race of human looking extraterrestrials with a love for fighting and war. Don't be fooled by their innocent and sexy appearances, at first glance they look nearly identical to humans. Except for the fact that they have wacky black hair, brown tails, and their ludicrously high strength makes it almost a death sentence to any enemy he/she comes across. They are experts of hand-to-hand combat and very efficient at handing energy weapons without issues. The saiyans possess a powerful military force that leaves some species of the universe afraid to challenge their prowess. Saiyans constantly devour any food they come across due to their extreme metabolism. As such, they are heavily resistant to high gravity in some worlds and in many cases, use high-gravity to further increase in pure strength. The saiyans have a love for fighting against foes, even fighting against their own can be considered to be honorable at some sectors of the galaxy. There are two sides towards the saiyans, those who are willing to protect and send justice to the galaxy are guardians. The other half are war-mongering, bloodthirsty, brutal soldiers that bring destruction and fear to the galaxy with no sense of mercy or forgiveness. Too bad the saiyans can't mentally comprehend Kevin's questionable paintings of esoteric value.
