To add music to the music player, simply create a new .txt file, and change the .txt bit into .config (Its name before the dot doesn't matter)
Create a new folder in your mods files named "interface", inside it make another one named "scripted", and inside it another named "fm_musicplayer"
Inside the "fm_musicplayer" folder, create a new .txt file and write this into it:
[
	[
		{
			"op": "add",
			"path": "/##files##/-",
			"value": "MYFILEPATH"
		}
	]
]
Replace "MYFILEPATH" with the path to your previously created .config file.
Make sure you have a / at the start of the file path. Example: "/interface/scripted/fm_musicplayer/my_music_list.config"
When you're done, rename the file to "musiclist.config.patch"


Now head back to the first file you've created, and copy this into it:
{
	// This is optional:
	"##album_icons##" : {
		"ALBUMNAME" : "PATHTOALBUMICON"
	},
	
	// This is not:
	"ALBUMNAME" : [
		{
			"name" : "TRACKNAME1",
			"directory" : "TRACKPATH1"
		},
		{
			"name" : "TRACKNAME2",
			"directory" : "TRACKPATH2"
		}
	]
}
Replace "ALBUMNAME" with the name of the album. (This name is displayed to the player)
Replace "PATHTOALBUMICON" with the path to the albums displayed image.
Replace "TRACKNAME" with the name of the track. (This name is displayed to the player)
Replace "TRACKPATH" with the path to the music file.

Note that if you want to add an image to the album, it must be 21x21 in size to not look out of place.
Also note that you don't have to worry about overrides, as the albums will get merged should there be two mods using the same album name. (Same name tracks will be duplicated though)

Here is a full example that add 3 tracks into the vanilla album: 

{
	"Starbound" : [
		{
			"name" : "Accretion Disc",
			"directory" : "/music/accretion-disc.ogg"
		},
		{
			"name" : "Arctic Battle 1",
			"directory" : "/music/arctic-battle1-loop.ogg"
		},
		{
			"name" : "Arctic Battle 2",
			"directory" : "/music/arctic-battle2-loop.ogg"
		}
	]
}

You can add as many tracks as you want into an album, but take note of the structure!
Every } must have a , after it, EXCEPT FOR THE LAST ONE!
