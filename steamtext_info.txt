Note: Uninstalling the mod will cause crashes, unless you wipe your universe and player folders. This is not avoidable. Be sure to back up your universe and player folders before installing.

[h2]Frackin Races is not compatible, as it is already included. If you install it as well, you will crash.[/h2]

Q: How do I tell if it's working?
A: Quite simple. When you launch starbound, look at the main menu screen. Do you see "Powered by Frackin Universe"? If so, you're good to go!
 
Q: Will this work on a server?
A: Read : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=734496146&searchtext=Frackin+Universe
 
Q: How do I run a server?
A: Read : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=735510285
 
Q: Do I need to delete my characters and universe before I start? Will it work with the character I already have?
(or any possible variation of this question)
A: No, you do not.
However, you will need to travel a fair ways away on your starmap in order to generate the new biome types. Generally a few seconds will do. So yes, it will work with your existing character. I recommend a clean universe, personally, but that's only if you absolutely want to have FU planets right near your starting location.
 
Q: I seem to be taking forever to generate my starting planets. It's in warp for like...ever.
A: Starbound is generating a universe and looking for a starting system that fits exact specifications. Because FU adds so many biomes it increases the time it takes to find the setup. I recommend visiting the Science Outpost when this happens, which can be triggered from your shiplocker items. By the time you come back you'll have your starting planet visible and a quest to begin!

Q: Where do I find (ITEM NAME)?!?!?!
A: Everything has a source. You just need to figure out what that source is. That's part of the mod. Exploration, experimentation...just seeing what sort of things lead to others and eventually ending up with a hard-core science lab. The wiki link given on this page right after the FAQ is a good source of information.
 
Q: Does FU add quests/missions or bosses?
A: Yes
 
Q: Does FU affect the main storyline or game progression?
A: No. The only true progression change is with EPP packs (see above sections for info on that). Otherwise you can progress exactly as normal through the base game.
 
Q: I can't find something on the Wiki
A: The wiki is player maintained. So, if you find something missing you can feel free to add it in.
 
Q: My EPP pack isn't working
A: Yes it is. Read the mod description information above for more details about how they operate now.
