[h1][b]Disclaimer: Installing FU is a one-way trip. FU will affect your game universe [u]and[/u] ALL characters.[/b][/h1]
 
If you uninstall the mod, your game will inevitably crash, unless you wipe your universe and player folders.
 
THIS CANNOT BE AVOIDED, so please do not request that we 'fix' this. It is not avoidable. If you are not sure you want to keep this mod, be sure to back up your universe and player folders before installing.

Error reports will be [u]much easier[/u] to fix if you provide a link to starbound.log file. How to do that?
[list][*] Go to starbound/storage/starbound.log
[*] Open that with text editor like Notepad
[*] Copy and paste its contents to pastebin.com
[*] Report with the link to that pastebin[/list]
 
[b]starbound.log helps us to detect what is the CAUSE of your error.[/b]

Perhaps largest mod for Starbound, FrackinUniverse combines new biomes, a hugely increased crafting system, science, monsters, tiles and hundreds of other assets to the game. It's 4 years in the making now, and quite huge. A few things to expect:

[list][*] Explore dozens of new biomes
[*] Create hundreds of new armors, weapons and tools that round out the vanilla tiers, or add "side-grades" with varied stats but unique stat bonuses, effects and abilities.
[*] 100+ new monsters (and several you might recognize from elsewhere!)
[*] Hundreds of new tiles, decorations, craftables and more
[*] a Science Outpost to act as a quest hub
[*] Hundreds of microdungeons, quests, and a new
[*] Massive end-game dungeons
[*] Power your lab with technological creations designed to make your resource-gathering easier and more efficient. Just be sure to have some generators and batteries to keep them going!
[*] Custom crew members with FU specific buffs to make your adventuring life much easier
[*] Vast array of new effects, both helpful and hazardous [/list]

[b][i]and much, much more![/i][/b]
 
Starbooze, Science and Bees mods are included!
[list][*](Starbooze - Create your own brew, wines and spirits, and use it to build a kick-ass pub!)
[*](Bees! - Catch, raise and breed bees to create even more types of bees! Get stung! Create bee-related tools, weapons and armor) [/list]

FU [u]will[/u] change several aspects of vanilla play, in terms of survival (see EPP notes below for a specific example) and has a learning curve. Some find the learning curve rather steep. Others do not. So bear this in mind.
[list][*]Your character will no longer possess a light aura in darkness, as darkness is an important part of many parts of FU.
[*]Walking on certain tile types will produce various effects. Slowed walking in mud, slipping on ice...burning on hot rocks, etc. Be prepared.
[*]If you can't figure out a recipe....build all the basic materials you can. Generally you're likely to be missing something in the progression and inadvertently trying to skip a step.[/list]
 
[h1]Changes on EPP[/h1]
We have modified the EPPs in a fundamental way, and there has been a fair amount of confusion about this.
[list]
[*] EPPs now *only* protect against the element they are designed for. (They also get an air supply)
[*] They do not provide *immunity* but rather *resistance* and come in tiers.
[*] You can stack EPPs with Augments and Armor to maximize chosen resitsances 
[*] Resistances for EPPs range from 20% (Basic) to 60% (Deadly)
[/list]

For example, the Cooling EPP does [u]NOT[/u] protect you against radiation. You're going to have to get more creative to survive in harsh environments. However, FU provides you with many methods of avoiding those hazards. Augments, genetically-engineered produce, armors, and advanced EPPs. All are craftable.
 
Play through the mod, work through the techs (including the genetically engineered plants!), and create stuff. Intro-level things unlock other things, and everything builds up until you are a kick-ass name-taking machine of destruction and SCIENCE.

Q: How do I tell if it's working?
A: Quite simple. When you launch starbound, look at the main menu screen. Do you see "Powered by Frackin Universe"? If so, you're good to go!
 
Q: Will this work on a server?
A: Read : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=734496146&searchtext=Frackin+Universe
 
Q: How do I run a server?
A: Read : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=735510285
 
Q: Do I need to delete my characters and universe before I start? Will it work with the character I already have?
(or any possible variation of this question)
A: No, you do not.
However, you will need to travel a fair ways away on your starmap in order to generate the new biome types. Generally a few seconds will do. So yes, it will work with your existing character. I recommend a clean universe, personally, but that's only if you absolutely want to have FU planets right near your starting location.
 
Q: I seem to be taking forever to generate my starting planets. It's in warp for like...ever.
A: Starbound is generating a universe and looking for a starting system that fits exact specifications. Because FU adds so many biomes it increases the time it takes to find the setup. I recommend visiting the Science Outpost when this happens, which can be triggered from your shiplocker items. By the time you come back you'll have your starting planet visible and a quest to begin!

Q: Where do I find (ITEM NAME)?!?!?!
A: Everything has a source. You just need to figure out what that source is. That's part of the mod. Exploration, experimentation...just seeing what sort of things lead to others and eventually ending up with a hard-core science lab. The wiki link given on this page right after the FAQ is a good source of information.
 
Q: Does FU add quests/missions or bosses?
A: Yes
 
Q: Does FU affect the main storyline or game progression?
A: No. The only true progression change is with EPP packs (see above sections for info on that). Otherwise you can progress exactly as normal through the base game.
 
Q: I can't find something on the Wiki
A: The wiki is player maintained. So, if you find something missing you can feel free to add it in.
 
Q: My EPP pack isn't working
A: Yes it is. Read the mod description information above for more details about how they operate now.
