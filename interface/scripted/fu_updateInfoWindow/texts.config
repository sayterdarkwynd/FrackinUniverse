Welcome to Frackin' Universe!

This window exists to guide new users and old through important changes, including updates to the mod itself, codexes and the like.

Before you can dismiss this pane, you'll have to wait 5 seconds. So take your time and read through the changes or refresh your memory if you've forgotten something.

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed.

Thanks, and have fun :)
