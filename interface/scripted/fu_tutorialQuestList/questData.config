//Want to add a new quest line?
//- Add a new table into lines

//- do "sublines" : ... and replace the ... with an array of subline names (sublines covered later).
//- do "requirements" : ... and replace the ... with an array of quests the player must complete before they can access this quest line.
//- do "secret" : ... and replace the ... with either true or false. If set to true, the quest line will not be visible to the player until its unlocked.
//- do "moneyRange" : ... and replace the ... with either a money range [10, 30] or a single value to reward the player with pixels upon completing the questline
//- do "rewards" : ... and replace the ... with an array holding arrays of rewarded items upon completing the questline
//-		"rewards" : [ [itemname, amount], [itemname, amount, {parameter : value}] ]

//Images for quest lines and sublines?
//- For quest lines, add a two frame image to the "banners" folder with the quest lines name, where one frame shows the unlocked image, and the other 
//shows when the line is unavailable. Follow the example there.
//- For sublines, just add an image into the "givers" folder with the sublines name. This image also serves as a separator between sublines inside the 
//questline.
