_____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.241^reset;
  
  * REGARDING NEW SAIL INTERFACE: if your Race mod 'Includes' FU (to force it to load after FU) it will *not* function with the new SAIL. This means Avali are screwed for now. However, we may opt to release an addon that loads after all the custom races to combat this issue. Have patience!
    Note that this also means any race mod that loads after FU , in general, will have the same issue.
