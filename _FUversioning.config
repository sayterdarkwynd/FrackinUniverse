Seriously people, learn to Video Game.

  * removes all SAIL patches from FU , as they are now located on the Workshop, Git and the CF Forums. Check the FU page for a link. You will need this is you use any custom races or SAIL mods, or the FU SAIL will not activate properly.  (xn-5o8h)

  * added Beast Harvesting Turret. It does what you assume. (Kherae)

  * added timers to some invisible monster spawners that spawn bosses
  
_____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.241^reset;
  
  * REGARDING NEW SAIL INTERFACE: if your Race mod 'Includes' FU (to force it to load after FU) it will *not* function with the new SAIL. This means Avali are screwed for now. However, we may opt to release an addon that loads after all the custom races to combat this issue. Have patience!
    Note that this also means any race mod that loads after FU , in general, will have the same issue.

  * new icons for space missions, stations etc (Rylasasin, me)
  
  * NEW : SAIL interface (zimberzimber). This should give you more info in-game as to your current status, as well as provide all the info SAIL previously did. Should be compatible with just about everything. If your race does not see a new SAIL console, let us know.
  
  * Pretty straightforward. Park ship on the orbit of planet, and Atmospheric Condenser will collect planetary resources, like it's built on the surface. (Vollch)
