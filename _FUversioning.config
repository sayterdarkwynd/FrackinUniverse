"changelog" : "

^orange;Official Wiki^reset;: frackinuniverse.miraheze.org^reset;


^cyan;6.5.3^reset;
------------------
* total leech per second is now capped to 10% per second as intended, rather than each individual leech instance. 
* New item: Empty Batteries Sensor, which is useful for turning the reactors On/Off when needed. It starts sending ON signal if all batteries combined are less than 10% full, and it doesn't stop sending ON signal until they become 100% full. Scan for info.
* Fixed typo in description of Chocolate Chip Cookies (it heals 100 hitpoints, not 3000).
* added 4 new illicit substances produced by the second-tier Narcotics madness research. They can be manufactured via an oven.

^cyan;6.5.2^reset;
------------------
* Sweetscoop grows a bit slower
* Sweetscoop produce is worth 10 less food value, making it less OP to spam.
* Crank Rifle, along with the Breach guns, have lower energy cost per shot, to make them more appealing.
* Fixed spontaneous uprooting of submerged non-aquatic plants that are allowed to be underwater (Algae, Erithian Algae, Blister Pod, Meatvine and X'i Bulbs)
* Corrected the dialog from equipping the item in the head slot to the back slot during tutorials
* Xi produce seeds much faster, effectively doubling their previous output. This should drastically improve early game pace.

Space & Mechs
------------------
* Repair Bay is worth using now since it heals 2% each tick instead of 2 health per tick.
* Space enemies now randomly drop the red or green batteries instead of green ones all the time.
* Red battery effectiveness increased slightly (so they're actually useful now)
* Green battery effectiveness nerfed slightly (they were too effective and trivialized mech fuel)

Erchius Mine
------------------
* the room with the first Infected Miner now has the switch to open the door. No more having to go into the back barracks just to open a door to proceed.
* Challenge reward: You are now rewarded with a stash of loot (including a Erchius Buddy) for defeating the Erchius Horror without using the Lasers (or bypassing it entirely). Using the laser or the microphere bypass forfeits the bonus loot.

Bounty Hunting
------------------
* New rewards for you to purchase from the peacekeeper shop: Box of Confiscated Guns, Box of Contraband Ore, and Illicit Research Data Disk.
Box of Confiscated Guns: Open to gain a random RNG ranged weapon, with high chance of Neo guns (Neo Pistol, Neo Uzi, Neo Tommygun, Neo Shotgun).
* Box of Contraband Ore: Open to gain a hodgepodge of ores. The ores are consistent with the 'Outlaw Asteroid Mine' Space mission.
* Illicit Research Data Disk: A new way to gain research from bounty hunting.
* Above rewards are Tier dependent. IE: You will gain more research from the Illicit Research purchased from the Tier 5 shop than you will from the Tier 2 one. The ore one has different ores (again, consistent with the space encounter.)
* All rewards are rarity-coded to avoid confusion.

^cyan;6.5.1^reset;
------------------
* Revamped how the centrifuge code operates RNG, increasing randomness.
* Rock Crusher speed slightly increased from 0.75s to 0.5s
* Fixed confusing quest descriptions that were asking for Wooden Sifter (they meant regular Sifter)
* Description of Hylotl: removed incorrect statement that they regenerate under rain (they don't)
* for folks in countries with strict regulations, Cocanium has been renamed Narcotium.
* Cluster Bomb weapon ability damage output reduced by 20%
* Alters the description in the items 'Awful Offal Smoothie' and 'Bloody Booger Bread', so that the negative maximum health debuff's time is shown to the player in said item descriptions
* Minor performance optimization in power-related code.
* Farmbeast Harvester Turret now works on friendly Cottonbops
* Fixed typo in description of Chocolate Honey Cookies (it heals 100 hitpoints, not 1500).
* 'gravgen' object ID is now the gravity generator (which amplifies gravity), not a gravity normalizer. the sprite has been switched with the Anti Gravity Generator (it is now ORANGE)
* gravnorm, the Gravity Normalizer, is now its own object, with a new sprite. which has GREEN.
reintroduced Anti Gravity Generator, this one is BLUE.
* Corrected the animation setup for the above generators, making their animations stop when they are shut off.
* corrected original 2 recipes and introduced a new one. all 3 generators are in the engineering research tree.
* added a stat to disable 'cheat death' mechanic
* deprecated some status effects related to the ancient grav gen code
* removed some unnecessary sprites and frame files for grav generators.
* negativemiasma stat gone. status effect no longer negates pressure protection, and instead negates healing more thoroughly. weapons which previously used it now use healingpenalty3, which reduces most incoming healing by 30%
* corrected an issue in the Crit check code
* fixed backend code that was recently changed, that resulted in racial weapon bonuses not working
* added failsafe to MM utility: if a player swaps their MM to one that has wire/paint modes without having yet unlocked them the slots will now be activated. this prevents a softlock (caused by another portion of code) that otherwise required console commands to fix.

^cyan;6.5.0^reset;
------------------

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.

^orange;If using BYOS mode with custom races^reset;: you must install the addon located on Steam/CF Forums (FU BYOS Race Addon).
^orange;If using Custom Races with FU SAIL^reset;: Install theaddon via Steam or CF Forums (FU SAIL Modded Race Support).

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed via the !Updates button.
