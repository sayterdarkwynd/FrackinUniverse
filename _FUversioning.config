____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.272 hotfix^reset;
  
  * Fixes a crash in gasworldnew.lua on gas giant planets, due to attempting to play a radio warning when the message timer was unset.
  
  * Fixes the default 'extreme cold' warning being played on Snowy planets. It has been replaced with an already-existing 'mild cold' warning.

____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.272^reset;
  
  * adds Zerchesium furniture (Opaque, Shinigami Apples)
  
  * corrects damage calculations from weather-based DoT effects. You'll have x1.5 less damage rounded up. (wannas)
  
  * ITDs are less laggy, and request small(1) numbers by default (TheCraiggers)
  
  * added a deed harvester of sorts. unlocked picking up silicon boards. (Kherae)
  
  * fixed an issue with giant slimes spitting non-existant projectiles
  
  * tentative fix for a duplication exploit involving slot split, and inverted output filters exceeding the container's size (Kherae)

  * Adds a new FU weather base library at stats/effects/fu_weathereffects/new/fuWeatherBase.lua, which implements a base class to handle most FU weather behaviours (wannas)
  
  * Reworks all (yes, all) of the weather scripts in stats/effects/fu_weathereffects/new/* to make full use of the base library. I have done this in an object-oriented (class-based) way, so they can simply extend and modify the behaviours of the base class. (wannas)
  
  * Rewrites the weather config .statuseffect files. I have attempted to keep as many of the numbers and parameters for each weather type in these files, keeping hard-coding in Lua to a minimum. This means that tweaks and balance changes (and even extra weather types) can be done exclusively in the JSON. (wannas)

  * fixes/adjustments to Energy Pack EPPs. They no longer have broken recharge rates.  (wannas)
  
  * Energy EPPs now block Lightning Storm effects. (wannas)
  
  * Armor-regen armors have had the same fix as above applied (wannas)
  
  * gembot animation fix
  

____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.271^reset;
  
  * moved a few missed sets of armor from the nanofab to the armory, rather than them being unobtainable! (oops!)
  
  * nanofab has a default menu rather than nothing, as default
  
  * arachne hardcore support added
  
  * clarified set bonus on Corsair armor
  
  * fixes an issue with tamed Magmatops still mutating
  
  * fixes blue Shiplocker inventory size to the proper amount (was 100, now 48)
  
____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.270^reset;

  * new look for all Lunari weapons (Shinigami Apples)
  
  * cutebow display bug fixed
  
  * corrected Fire Shard Pistol using image when equipped
  
  * weather effects revised. Effects should be approximately the same, but working better due to streamlining of code. (wannas)
  
    * All relevant immunity stats should now protect against weather effects, even if they are not the selected blockingStat (previously, only the blockingStat or resistance threshold would work).
    
    * Some of the issues with spamming the SAIL warnings should be fixed (for example Aether warnings when beaming back to ship).
    
    * Weird behaviours where the weather or radio-message timers ticked down multiple times have been removed.
    
    * Movement penalties when at low health in Desert (25% HP) and Jungle (33% HP) biome weathers are now correctly implemented.
    
    * Fixed randomised messages for Insanity and Pressure weather effects.
    
    * Internally, effects should hopefully no longer be expired and re-applied every tick.
    
____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.2695^reset;
  
  * NANOFABRICATOR/TINKER TABLE no longer does Armor. The armors have been moved to their relevant station (Sewing or Armory). It was counter-intutive.

  * corrects nightar crash on mech deploy from missing cinematic
  
____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.269^reset;
  
  * fixed cost on the Capture Pod gun. It now takes x2000 10k voxels, rather than 20 million (which was impossible to buy)
  
  * you'll now get a visual warning when your Max HP reduces on Prot and Radioactive worlds
  
  * Cooked Ham, Lobster Paste on Toast now properly appear in the cooking crafting menu
  
  * adds Zerchesium Fists, Scythe, Quarterstaff, Solarium Fists and Prismatic Cestus (Mad Jack)
