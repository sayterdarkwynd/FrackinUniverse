 Welcome to ^green;Frackin' Universe^reset;!
 
   Don't be afraid mod user, this window is here to inform you about updates, and provide some basic info about them. You can close it after 5 seconds.
   
   Don't worry, this window will pop-up only when you enter a new character or when entering an already existing character after an FU update.

  ______________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.5.5^reset;   
  
  * added new farmable pet: Poptops! These are non-aggressive carnivores for your farm different from wild ones, and produce Sharpened Claws. You get your first eggs from Mama Poptop.
  
  * slowed down hunger notifier hearts on farmable pets
  
  * farm animals no longer take random damage
  
  * all farmable pets now have a chance to drop Research when harvested
  
  * starvation indicator should no longer spam insanely fast
  
  * farmable pets now poop, which can be used in a Growing Tray or Hydroponics Tray as decent fertilizer 
  
  * animal diet type and hungerTime should now properly be set in the creatures .monster file
  
  
  (cat2002)
  
  * added trough recognition function to allow other forms of animal trough later

  ^cyan;New in version 5.5.4^reset;   
  
  
  * changed Scorchburst alt fire to be less lag-inducing. It now uses a slower fire rate, and a variable projectile time. It gains 1 additional DoT fireball to its spread and uses less energy.
  
  (zimberzimber)
  * ^orange;TEMPORARILY^reset; disabled Medical Enhancer purchases at Medical Stations. We found a crippling bug bricking some folks characters due to SBs handling of persistent effects. this will be adjusted soon.
  
  (missandri)
  * Integration of the Better Crafted Blocks: FU Addon mod into FU itself
  
  (the observer)
  * updated dungeon reward weapons based on user feedback
  
  (cat2002)
  * new farm animal feeding system. Place animal feed in a trough (crafted at the Foraging station) rather than chucking it on the ground. Animals will seek out their food. 
  
  * the above change alters pet bahavior files for farm animals. 
  
  * animals cannot produce their resources unless they are fed and happy.
  
  * Higher animal happiness = higher resource production. Starving animals lose happiness and thus production rates.
  
  * 50% Happiness = 100% production, 100% Happiness = 200% production
  
  * animals have preferred food types. Carnivores will not eat vegetation, while herbivores wont touch meat.
  
  * foods eaten by cattle increase hunger by the food value of the item
  
  * Cattle Feed will only feed herbivores and omnivores
  
  * Cattle Feed is now a Food item
  
  * updated quest for Cattle Feed to reflect these changes

  ^cyan;New in version 5.5.3^reset;   
  
  - added mech support for SRW Mechs mod
  
  - Low-tier mech booster speed increased to make it a bit less hazardous with starter mechs. The actual *stats* of the Basic mech parts remains the same. The *modifiers* are increased. This should allow you to avoid things a bit, and move faster than a snail.
  
  ^green;(The Observer)^reset;
  - Added buttons so players who died inside can get into the Green Tower dungeon cap
  
  ^cyan;(Lucca)^reset;
  - ITDs learn another new trick: round-robin within containers! Activate 'Split Slots' mode on the ITD and combine it with output slot settings to split outputs within containers evenly between all valid outputs. This mode won't do anything if there are no output slot restrictions set unless output is inverted. 'Split Slots' stacks with the 'Even Split' mode to combo well with multi-Fission Reactor setups.
  - Fixes the item vacuum bug
  - Fixes the item dupe bug
  
  ^yellow;(zimberzimber)^reset;
  - Modified how questline completion is stored. Note that you *will* get questline rewards a second time if already complete from this change
  - All questlines are saved in one status property as a long string
  - Military space stations now sell the exact same weapon you see in the shop (instead of a re-roll), leveled, and with a price to fit the level
  - Minor popup window modifications
  - Version logging is less misleading to the user
  - Minor handling modifications
  - Added popup window to quickbar   
______________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.5.2^reset;
  
  - Updates the atmospheric condenser to use a more customizable output system and removes the dated variable cooldowns.(Lucca)
  
  - ITDs also learn a new trick: splitting their inputs (more or less) evenly between all output containers! Simply click the 'Even Split' button on the ITD interface to activate this mode, which also respects packet multiple settings. (Lucca)
  
  - Added this popup Update screen (zimberzimber)
  
  - The early implementation of a new Research UI. You cannot currently access it as a player, for there is a lot of work to do on the back end for this update still (research trees, costs etc). But the basics are there for use. (zimberzimber)
  
  - Added ^orange;Space Station Revamp^reset; (zimberzimber): 
______________________________________________________
  ^orange;What do Stations Do Now?^reset;
  
  - The vendor in space stations is now replaced with a console. (you can't miss it) Upon interaction, you will be greated with a new interface through which you'll be accessing the new features. In addition, theres flavored dialogue, and an animated talker! (Currently just a gray AI, but will be replaced with races later, along with race fitting texts)
  
  - Instead of being able to buy one type of goods, and sell only one in a station, you can now buy and sell any of the goods, including new ones!
  
  - In addition, goods are no longer an item and do not take up inventory space, they are currency, acting like pixels or essence for the matter. Goods buy/sell prices depend on the stock of the station.
  
  - If a station has a lot of something, its value will be low, but if they don't have much of it, the value increases!
  
  - Stock also largely depends on the type of station you're visiting. Trading stations have a lot of minerals and will gladly buy electronics, but scientific stations have lots of electronics, and are in need of minerals! Buy for low, sell fo high, and soon you'll be making a nice profit!
  
  - You can now buy/sell things at station shops. The stock is different from station to station, and is themed after the station type! (medical selling stimpaks, military selling weapons, etc...) Some things can even affect the prices in your favor...
  
  - ^orange;Medical stations^reset; let you buy unique, long lasting, persisting-through-death buffs (aka : enhancers) which have strong effects, but also come with some downsides. In addition, you can only purchase an enhancer once every long period of time. But should the effect vore you, you can always remove it at any medical station. Each station has different options to choose from.
  
  - ^orange;Military stations^reset; let you hire a single (per station) crew member. But its not one of your generic 'find person' kind of member, they all pack quite a punch and are definitly worth your time!
  
  - ^orange;Trading stations^reset; accept investments from outside sources, and will gladly shift the shops prices in your favor should you invest enough. If you're super generous, they'll make sure to spread your name across the stars, modifying prices in your favor across all space stations.
  
  - ^orange;Scientific stations^reset; are still in progress. But for now, they turn into another, random station
  
  - Those unqiue, long lasting, persisting-through-death buffs obtained from medical station which I mentioned earlier? Their effects are quite strong, but their downside is heavy as well. Not every enhancers fits every play style, but I'm sure you'll find something you like! You can tell what each enhancer does simply by clicking them in the medical special menu.
