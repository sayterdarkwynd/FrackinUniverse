  -- FRACKIN RACES INTEGRATION --
  * FrackinRaces is now built into FU. There's no reason for it not to be, given that we add 13 races, plus the 7 from the game, and most users also have Elithian Races and Avali installed. (Lucca)
  * The above means, if you have FrackinRaces installed separately it must now be removed. You do not need it anymore.
  * On your ships SAIL, in the MISC section, you will find a new option to enable and disable Race Abilities. Note that some abilities may be hard-coded onto races and not remove (there may be edge cases), but most should disable if desired. These abilities are ON by default. (Lucca)
  * added back-end stats to support swapping race abilities (Lucca)
  * updated cat_primary.lua (Kherae)
  * veluu claw (razor claw) tech now spawns projectile based on mouth pos, so it looks less silly (Kherae)
  * added fu_creationDate status property. Applies itself only once. (Kherae)

  -- Quests --
  * moved many quests from giving blueprint items, to directly unlocking recipes (Kherae)
  * augment giving quests (FU anyway), now unlock blueprints for them as well (Kherae)
  
  -- Weapons --
  * all spears should now count as hunting weapons, not just FU spears (Kherae)
  * adjusted several weapons' elementalTypes so that they matched what the weapons actually did. (Kherae)
  * Cultist staves are now tagged as Elder for set bonuses (Kherae)
  
  -- Monsters --
  * starspawn series no longer get massive resists from their bubbles, they instead get a shield equal to their health. uptime unchanged (20s duration, 30s cd, so 10s open). Shield strength indicated by opacity. Hit hard or play smart. (Kherae)
  
  -- Combat --
  * Protection (armor) stat values above 100 will now have an effect. The effectiveness of Protection now caps at a stat value of 200. (solardawning)

  -- Missions --
  * left a hint in the mech tutorial's intro radio message about what happens if 'unauthorized user' pops up (Kherae)
  
  -- UI --
  * quest reward related UI panes now expanded to 5 slots (Kherae)

  -- Misc --
  * added 'take all' to centrifuges (Kherae)
  * implemented workaround for starrypy server owners using the message blocker plugin, thus resulting in various effects not functioning. workaround includes tracking data, in case someone decides to grief. (Kherae)
  * adjusted arctic/radiation immunity applying crewmembers: they now apply a version with an icon, for tracking. so do related foods. (Kherae)
  * added '[FU]' tag to avali produce and plants for easier differentiation (Kherae)
  * added player.getEquippedItems support to deployment hack (Kherae)

  * applied a regenerating energy shield to serpent droids (Kherae)
  * adjusted food energy regen effects and tooltips, including fixing mint, which was 10x stronger than intended (50% instead of 5%). food energy regen effects are now (effect)/2 for energy regen and half that for energy regen block. IE: haleflower is 30% increased energy regen and 15% reduced energy regen block. (Kherae)

  -- Techs --
  * reworked phase attack. it is no longer reasonably possible to force scientific notation on the char sheet. (Kherae)

  -- Bugs --
  * adjusted blast furnace and arc smelter 'take all' downward (Kherae)
