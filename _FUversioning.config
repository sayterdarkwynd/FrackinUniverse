  ^cyan;6.2.0^reset;
  -------------------
  * lab support tiles are now craftable/unlockable
  * Slime Grenade Launcher improved. Damage increase: 4 > 7.25, Explosion Time: 10 > 5 second fuse, Projectile Speed: 30 > 40. It properly applies Poison damage, Slow and DoT.
  * Increased the cost of purchasing Rob and Roger Repairos from Penguin Pete, and decreased the discount of Roger Repairos.
  * corrected character extender not registering right-hand-side races
  * It now costs 24 (rather than 8) plasmic fluid to create the x2 Xi Bulbs
  * removed a duplicate Sulphur value from deep honey ore generation
  * renamed 'Logic Node' to 'On/Off Switch' in tooltips
  * renamed Deadly Cold to Extreme Cold (same for Heat, Radiation) in tooltips and GPS 
  * Added a mission to SAIL to allow players to re-visit the Outpost if the bookmark is deleted or lost, as already existed with the Science Outpost. To enable this mission on pre-existing characters, use the command /startquest '\"fu_outpost\"' in admin mode.   
  * GiC Food items now have food effects. No longer will Bunnykin or Saturnians be able to safely eat canned tuna.
  * Only items that are identifiable (IE: Canned Chicken Soup, XBLT Sandwich, Chocolate Energy Bar, etc.) have food effects. Items that are ambigous as to what they contain (IE: K-Ration, Colony Guard Ration, etc) remain universal.
  * GiC Florans are carnivores now. 
  * Frackin and Vanilla foods are now a little more specific on what exactly they are. Fruity foods (IE Fruit Salad) are now labeled as such rather than simply 'herbivore'. Sugar Foods are now labeled as such as well. Some foods that didn't have labels now have them (ie Chocolate Bars). This makes it easier for sugar and fruit eaters, and avoids plant-based nasty surprises for carnivores.
  * Cakes (including coffee, carrot, and chocolate cakes) are now omnivore foods (new category: Cake Food) as they contain dairy, egg, and plants, and can no longer be consumed by herbivores or carnivores.
  * As a response to this, I have created 'vegan' versions of these cakes that are made with eggshoot and coconut milk instead that can be consumed by herbivores. Carnivores are still out of luck though.
  * Cheese is now correctly labeled as dairy
  * removed stat effect removal from uninit block on certain attacks, as it was causing crashes and making worlds persistently crash in exceptionally niche cases.
  * Dodge techs should properly apply their defense bonuses from armor sets and racials that improve Tech Efficiency.
  * Buffed the outputs of some tile crafting recipes.
  * Updated the Eld'uukhar flag recipe

	"welcome" : "Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.

^orange;If using BYOS mode with custom races^reset;: you must install the addon located on Steam/CF Forums (FU BYOS Race Addon).
^orange;If using Custom Races with FU SAIL^reset;: Install theaddon via Steam or CF Forums (FU SAIL Modded Race Support).

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed via the !Updates button.
Please make sure you are not using anything included in the RED (and ideally the other colors too) on the Info tab below.

A: Yes, there is a Discord server. Check the mods page for a link.

Q: Where can I report issues/bugs, contribute, or make suggestions?
