  ^cyan;6.1.28^reset;

  * Environmental effects are now labelled Mild/Moderate/Extreme to make it more apparent which is implied in an environment.
  * Physics Field techs no longer use energy when on your ship
  * Players on their ship now have a status property set : player.ownShipWorldId

  -------------------  
  ^cyan;6.1.28^reset;
  
  Github release includes a PAK file this time, so users on that build have drastically improved performance simply using it, instead of the entire unzipped file structure.
  
  -- Assets --
  * Peacekeeper bed and couch added

  -- Misc --
  * -all- bee weapons should now be considered Bio-Weapons
  * Pickaxes as a whole are more durable. 
  * Players now have access to recipes for the 'platinum' pickaxes and drills (now labelled as Titanium)

  -- Bugs --
  * The Precursor converter no longer processes items in its first output slot.
  * Frames should only be consumed if drones and queens are both present in the hive.
  * Crew bonus diminishing returns adjusted. This should result in proper incremental increases for bonuses that currently do not operate according to expectations.

  * fixed unifiedgravmod code fail. It should now work properly.

  -------------------
  ^cyan;6.1.26^reset;

  -- Assets --
  * reworked the ITD UI to be a lot less cramped and confusing.

  -- Misc --
  * Mechs properly apply their defense to incoming damage
  * Mechs lacking environmental protection will now lose health in addition to energy. Both will decrement over time. (you can still move, and function, but one hit will kill you)
  * Extractor tiers adjusted slightly on the UI side. Hand Mills now have less input and output slots, and standard Extractors have one less input slot. Quantums have additional output slots.
  * all tiers of extractor now require power, rather than only the Quantum. 10J/30J/60J, respectively. Hand Mills remain unpowered.
  * swapped node positions on all Extractors to not be backwards. You may need to break and re-place your Extractors.
  * extractors now all inform the user that they can place them on floors and ceilings, as this seems to have been unknown!
  * Hand Mills have less input and output slots
  * gave khe in the science outpost a unique ID, in preparation for upcoming content
  * updated khe's wares so that the artifacts she sells come pre-scanned
  * added a special quest script for upcoming content

  * extracting larva now produces some pus
  * Tabula Rasa terraformers can now be crafted.
  * The Instafreud no longer mirrors its text when reversed.

  * added generic 'hold down key to use tech' status effect
  * revised x'i tech's tooltip to be clearer, and added the above as an indicator for when it's active.
  * revised crew contract tooltips for crew to indicate that ship mass does not stack with similar values. corrected janitor,mechanic, mechanic 2 not applying ship mass reductions due to improperly configured crew parameter.
  * extractor_xeno_common now supports the inputSlot parameter on the object using it, in the same way centrifuges do.
  
  -- Bugs --
  * fixed a harmless goof in the xi racial tech after prior edits that would result in the indicator becoming stuck
  * Akkimari now have a respawn cinematic in Hardcore mode.
  * Elithian advanced tier mech bodies should properly apply resistances

  * Watchers are more clear about what they are and how they impact performance, when inspected.

  * Gave the ITD Handler objects new icons
  * Added tags to the vast, vast majority of armor, particularly armor that's upgradeable. This should allow users to search in their crafting table to more directly find armors that suit their needs.
  * toned down geologist attack goggles scaling a bit
  * hardy geologist goggles defense boost (which was a measly +2) is now a unique effect (granting 1.1 Defense multiplier), and thus can be stacked with consumables
  * added hard target handling to weakpoison (no more %hp dmg vs special status immune targets)
  * implemented a stacking damage, hybrid bioweapon/hoarfrost, status effect with fixed duration: fuwanderingplague. still needs attaching to a melee weapon
  * extended some effectUtil functions to allow them specify a source for the applied effect
  * divided densinium EVA's tooltip among its 3 pieces
  * extended armor buildscript: it now appends armor class information to the crafting description and has a section above the armor tooltip.

  -- Bugs --
  * corrected duplicate maxHealth in nonpareil top
  * corrected plebeian clothes. the regen is not, nor has ever been, a percentage. it is a flat 0.3 health regen. not 0.3%, not 3%, but 0.3.
  * Fixed an issue where players could not beam up in Extra Dungeons. They now follow the same rules as all other dungeon instances.

  * added Glitchtop, though a far less nasty version than the typical PB variant

  -- Gear --

  * Ancient Spear, Core Spear and Uranium Spear are now Lances

  * Tungsten hammers and axes can now be researched
  * Titanium and Durasteel shields no longer appear in the Armory's armour tab
  * due to severe clientside performance impact: reduced base anim update rate for batteries from 10/s to 3/s, reduced further as more batteries are in close proximity (about 16 blocks)
  
  --------------------
  ^cyan;6.1.23 ^reset;

  - Biomes --
  * various parallax tweaks to Aether (terrestrial) biomes
  * Added new subsurface parallax image to replace underground background
  * Added liquid params so terrestrial display shows proper planet blackground (rather than pink erchius)

  * Changed some of the wording in the novakid race effect description
  * Updated Fenerox default scan descriptions.
  * The Peglaci colony is no longer tile-protected.
  * revised tile protection states on shoggoth's arena. it should no longer be possible to place objects or tiles (except for miniscule windows), and shoggoth will no longer care about shield/field generator usage even if someone DOES manage to place them. It is not, however, recommended to place shoggoth outside of DF2 anymore for that very reason.  
  * added minor, brief, barely noticeable levitation effect to shoggoth if it spends ~9s unable to move while trying to do so, with a brief, tiny movement boost up whatever slope it might be stuck on
  * corrected charge phases, so that shoggoth will no longer stall during them, and instead will transition into a tentacle swipe when in range of the player
  * Dead Core blocks now drop as items when mined.
  * Underground Challenge Lab radar microdungeons should now connect more cleanly to their surroundings.
  * adjusted nearly every seed rarity to match expectations based on research nodes

  -- Bugs --
  * Tungsten Shield appears in the correct station
  * Fixed a checkpoint bug in Mount Gigant allowing players to skip the first Vault Guardian boss fight.
  * corrected Omega Laser mech arm damage scaling
  * Removed the extraction recipe from platinum blocks.
  * The description for the Neuropod Buld had an extra comma that made things look off. Also, the duration of the defense penalty didn't match the description.
  * Fixed a broken laser puzzle in Brine Star, and replaced its rail platforms with solid rail platforms.
  * Mech Repair Pod should properly heal mech health rather than Fuel
  * Added an invisible roof to the Snowcrash mission, and improved the final building.

  ---------------------
  ^cyan;6.1.221 ^reset;
  
  -- Racial --
  * passive stat values for raceeffects are now clamped to ranges as follows:
    - resistances: amount (-1.0 to 1.0), effectiveMultiplier (0.0 to 2.0)
    - max energy and max health: amount(-50 to 50), baseMultiplier(-50% to +50%), effectiveMultiplier(0.7x to 1.5x)
    - protection (Defense): amount(-25 to 25), effectiveMultiplier(0.7x to 1.3x)
    - power (Damage): amount(-0.5 to 0.5), baseMultiplier(-50% to +50%), effectiveMultiplier(0.7x to 1.3x)
    this is primarily to address irresponsible mod authors giving their races excessive values (IE: kitsune patch giving +150% max energy, which is normally +150)

  -- Bugs -- 
  * Fixed 'Press E to interact' being displayed in the Kirhos, Mantizi and Tenebrhae T0 ships.
  * fixed a recursion issue with fu_nooxygen
  * Fixed an issue causing the Tenebrhae BYOS ship to fail to generate
  * Fixed typo on bee quest.
  * Realigned the Mantizi SAIL. It will no longer bounce around in its chatbox while talking.

	"welcome" : "Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.

^orange;If using BYOS mode with custom races^reset;: you must install the addon located on Steam/CF Forums (FU BYOS Race Addon).
^orange;If using Custom Races with FU SAIL^reset;: Install theaddon via Steam or CF Forums (FU SAIL Modded Race Support).

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed via the !Updates button.
Please make sure you are not using anything included in the RED (and ideally the other colors too) on the Info tab below.
