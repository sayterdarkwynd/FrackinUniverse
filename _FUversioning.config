  ^orange;Official Wiki^reset;: frackinuniverse.miraheze.org^reset;

  ^cyan;6.0.155 ^reset;

  -- Research --
  * Nocxium can now -only- be found in the Metaphysics tree. It is no longer in the Geology tree. Aetherium now represents the end-tier there.
  
  -- Resources --
  * Mech Fuel and Unrefined Mech Fuel are now named Unrefined Fuel and Refined Fuel

  -- Races --
  * Apex mining laser bonus now only applies for the hands wielding the Mining Laser.

  -- Power --
  * Reduced production time and rates in centrifuges (Industrial, Lab, Gas). Industrial is now the fastest centrifuge with the worst success chance, while Gas is slower but succeeds often. The Lab centrifuge is in the middle.
  * Overall, centrifuges process slower than before as they were vastly overperforming.

  -- Monsters --
  * fixed precursor warbot spawning level 0 allies. they currently spawn at world threat level, making them a credible threat
  * shoggoth's spawned minions now spawn at 1/4 of shoggoth's level, instead of 0
  * shoggoth will now munch in front. no more getting stuck behind a tile (hopefully)
  * fixed an obscure condition that could result in shoggoth being stuck at 0 hp and unkillable

  -- Misc --
  * Kirhosi Sniper Rifle and Kirhosi Pistol have had their DPS lowered
  * Kirhosi Pistol fire rate slightly reduced (0.3 -> 0.35)
  * Neuropod has been revised. Rather than buff movement and energy it now provides a temporary bonus to Research gain.
  * hiddeneva suit should now be dyable
  * Volcanologist and Arctic crew members give 30% protection against their element type. Their durations are increased from 300s to 900s.
  * new status icons! (Malthinae)
  * added more sources options for Research loot from NPCs and Monsters
  * implemented a persistent 1 minute cooldown on weather messages via status property
  * adjusted quest text of 'Perfect Threads' to be a bit more informative.
  * Renamed Protectorate Rifle to Protectorate Carbine
  * added Protectorate Rifle
  * Rad Burn has been retuned
  * Upgrading to the Fission Furnace now requires different materials.
  * dweller and spacefarer mk1 converted to setbonuses_common
  * Upgrading to the Fission Furnace now requires Aegisalt instead of Zerchesium
  * Wiki location is much more apparent (main screen, codexes), to get players using it and not the outdated Fandom one that is confusing users.
  * Unrefined Mech Fuel now breaks down into Oil instead of Mercury
  * if an npc or player manages to survive a hit from any source with less than 1 hp, they now have a chance to survive it, but only once every 7 seconds.
  * implemented special world property handling in FR code, for NPCs, for compatibility with other mods: instance worlds can now disable FR on all npcs in them. This addresses some breakage in shellguard's toy arena missions, primarily.
  * Spawners:
    - added support for the npcLevelOffset and monsterLevelOffset parameters, allowing monsters to be spawned at world level plus an offset.
    - removed hard-set level ranges on various monster and npc spawners, thus allowing the level parameters to not need be set in dungeons. this results in the spawners creating their entities at world threat level.
    - removed hard-coded enemy levels from most enemies in most dungeons. this will have no impact on regular missions, but was needed for the 'hard' mode variants.

  -- Bugs --
  * Farmed cotton-bops should be killable
  * removed basic gases from merchantpools and stations
  * Bonus entries for disabled Blast Furnace ore processing were left in last weeks update. These are now removed.
  * Fixes the issue with trying to racialise to the elduu ship hatch
  * mashes use 0 sec craft instead of 0.01. This removes a massive lag spike whenever you craft them.
  * Rebalanced Hydraulic Dynamo
  * Rebalanced Electric Furnace
  * Mad Science Jacket and Pants should properly show their stats
  * fixed an error in fubuildarmor.lua when item configs are missing levels

  * Avian Luxury: Randomized Cultist Spawn. Max 2 with Spawnchance of 40
  * Villagerhouse 1 and 2: 1 guaranteed avian that has a 1/10 chance of being a friendlyguard, 9/10 chance of being a villager. 35% chance of spawning a roomie/lover/whatever. Roomie is usually an avian, but can be other things. First use of the 'Advanced Spawner'.

  ^cyan;6.0.153 ^reset;

  ^orange;-- Weapon Shuffler ^green;(NEW!)^reset;^orange; --^reset;
    - takes one upgrade module and an RNG item (weapons, primarily) and will make another with the same level and base item, but a new seed and stats.
    - unlocked alongside matter converter, which is used to make it.

  ^cyan;-- Shrine of Souls --^reset;
  * it is now a crafting interface
  * moved crystal skull to shrine, and its unlock to the same node. you will have to pick one up from the tenebhrae at the science outpost to get this started.
  * added the advanced erchius buddies to the shrine, unlocked via madness, requiring an erchius shard (the augment), dark and red matter.

  ^yellow;-- Bows --^reset;
  * draw time reductions can no longer bring draw time to negative values, breaking the script and damage calculations
  * draw time reductions no longer reduce damage values to miniscule numbers
  * quivers' raw damage increases are no longer a hard override, and instead an additive number
  * flat value draw time reductions changed to draw speed increases, similar in principle to a fire rate increase.

  * fixed a logic failure in superdark.lua
  * fixed an error in resourceconvert.lua when resources go negative via status effects.
  * unknown worlds now can roll 'airless' and 'super dark' effects. They will be re-randomized on next visit.
  * corrected a mistake in crucible code which prevented transmutation matrices from functioning.
  * gunfire/gunfirefixed: NPCs no longer have forced reload on weapon swap, unless the magazine was actually empty, to prevent annoying spammy reload issues -especially- with crew.
  * corrected LMH fuel value tooltip (to 32, rather than old value of 70)
  * increased element count cutoff threshold to 250, in fuweaponupgrade and fu_multiupgrade. this will address being unable to upgrade multidetectors
  * fixed a botched fix in radioactiveplant

	"welcome" : "Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.

^orange;If using BYOS mode with custom races^reset;: you must install the addon located on Steam/CF Forums (FU BYOS Race Addon).
^orange;If using Custom Races with FU SAIL^reset;: Install theaddon via Steam or CF Forums (FU SAIL Modded Race Support).

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed via the !Updates button.
