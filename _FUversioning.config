  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  ^cyan;6.0.155 ^reset;

  -- Research --
  * Nocxium can now -only- be found in the Metaphysics tree. It is no longer in the Geology tree. Aetherium now represents the end-tier there.
  
  -- Resources --
  * Mech Fuel and Unrefined Mech Fuel are now named Unrefined Fuel and Refined Fuel

  -- Races --
  * Apex mining laser bonus now only applies for the hands wielding the Mining Laser.

  -- Power --
  * Reduced production time and rates in centrifuges (Industrial, Lab, Gas). Industrial is now the fastest centrifuge with the worst success chance, while Gas is slower but succeeds often. The Lab centrifuge is in the middle.
  * Overall, centrifuges process slower than before as they were vastly overperforming.

  -- Monsters --
  * fixed precursor warbot spawning level 0 allies. they currently spawn at world threat level, making them a credible threat
  * shoggoth's spawned minions now spawn at 1/4 of shoggoth's level, instead of 0
  * shoggoth will now munch in front. no more getting stuck behind a tile (hopefully)
  * fixed an obscure condition that could result in shoggoth being stuck at 0 hp and unkillable

  -- Misc --
  * Kirhosi Sniper Rifle and Kirhosi Pistol have had their DPS lowered
  * Kirhosi Pistol fire rate slightly reduced (0.3 -> 0.35)
  * Neuropod has been revised. Rather than buff movement and energy it now provides a temporary bonus to Research gain.

  * if an npc or player manages to survive a hit from any source with less than 1 hp, they now have a chance to survive it, but only once every 7 seconds.
  * implemented special world property handling in FR code, for NPCs, for compatibility with other mods: instance worlds can now disable FR on all npcs in them. This addresses some breakage in shellguard's toy arena missions, primarily.
  * Spawners:
    - added support for the npcLevelOffset and monsterLevelOffset parameters, allowing monsters to be spawned at world level plus an offset.
    - removed hard-set level ranges on various monster and npc spawners, thus allowing the level parameters to not need be set in dungeons. this results in the spawners creating their entities at world threat level.
    - removed hard-coded enemy levels from most enemies in most dungeons. this will have no impact on regular missions, but was needed for the 'hard' mode variants.

  -- Bugs --
  * Farmed cotton-bops should be killable

  * Bonus entries for disabled Blast Furnace ore processing were left in last weeks update. These are now removed.

  * Avian Luxury: Randomized Cultist Spawn. Max 2 with Spawnchance of 40
  * Villagerhouse 1 and 2: 1 guaranteed avian that has a 1/10 chance of being a friendlyguard, 9/10 chance of being a villager. 35% chance of spawning a roomie/lover/whatever. Roomie is usually an avian, but can be other things. First use of the 'Advanced Spawner'.

  ^yellow;-- Bows --^reset;

  * draw time reductions no longer reduce damage values to miniscule numbers
  * quivers' raw damage increases are no longer a hard override, and instead an additive number

	"welcome" : "Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.

^orange;If using BYOS mode with custom races^reset;: you must install the addon located on Steam/CF Forums (FU BYOS Race Addon).
^orange;If using Custom Races with FU SAIL^reset;: Install theaddon via Steam or CF Forums (FU SAIL Modded Race Support).

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed via the !Updates button.
