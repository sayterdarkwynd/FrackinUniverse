____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.272^reset;
  
  * adds Zerchesium furniture (Opaque, Shinigami Apples)
  
  * corrects damage calculations from weather-based DoT effects. You'll have x1.5 less damage rounded up. (wannas)
  
  * ITDs are less laggy, and request small(1) numbers by default (TheCraiggers)
  
  * added a deed harvester of sorts. unlocked picking up silicon boards. (Kherae)
  
  * fixed an issue with giant slimes spitting non-existant projectiles
  
  * tentative fix for a duplication exploit involving slot split, and inverted output filters exceeding the container's size (Kherae)

  * Adds a new FU weather base library at stats/effects/fu_weathereffects/new/fuWeatherBase.lua, which implements a base class to handle most FU weather behaviours (wannas)
  
  * Reworks all (yes, all) of the weather scripts in stats/effects/fu_weathereffects/new/* to make full use of the base library. I have done this in an object-oriented (class-based) way, so they can simply extend and modify the behaviours of the base class. (wannas)
  
  * Rewrites the weather config .statuseffect files. I have attempted to keep as many of the numbers and parameters for each weather type in these files, keeping hard-coding in Lua to a minimum. This means that tweaks and balance changes (and even extra weather types) can be done exclusively in the JSON. (wannas)

  * fixes/adjustments to Energy Pack EPPs. They no longer have broken recharge rates.  (wannas)
  
  * Energy EPPs now block Lightning Storm effects. (wannas)
  
  * Armor-regen armors have had the same fix as above applied (wannas)
  
  * gembot animation fix

  * cutebow display bug fixed
  
  * corrected Fire Shard Pistol using image when equipped
  
  * weather effects revised. Effects should be approximately the same, but working better due to streamlining of code. (wannas)
  
    * All relevant immunity stats should now protect against weather effects, even if they are not the selected blockingStat (previously, only the blockingStat or resistance threshold would work).
    
    * Some of the issues with spamming the SAIL warnings should be fixed (for example Aether warnings when beaming back to ship).
    
    * Weird behaviours where the weather or radio-message timers ticked down multiple times have been removed.
    
    * Movement penalties when at low health in Desert (25% HP) and Jungle (33% HP) biome weathers are now correctly implemented.
    
    * Fixed randomised messages for Insanity and Pressure weather effects.
