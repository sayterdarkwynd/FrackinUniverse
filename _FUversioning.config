 Welcome to ^green;Frackin' Universe^reset;!


_____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.1^reset;  
  

  * Fixes the issue with the decorative FTL drive placement images. Also makes it so that the zero-g and no oxygen should work on other peoples BYOS ships. Re-does the universe_server.config.patch to make it match the format of the patch mod + removes non-FR supported races (NOTE: AVAILI WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET BYOS SUPPORT INCLUDED IN FU DIRECTLY (NEEDS A PATCH MOD))
  
  * Explosive-based doors are now much more apparent
  
  * added lootboxes
  
  * Fixed targetting/completion issues with the starter quest changes (hopefully)
  
  * Reworked star generation a bit, at the celestial level. You'll find a more balanced spread of star types, with rarer types now being much more difficult to find. Black and Dying stars are less likely to appear, while Red should appear far more often.
  
  * Redid a bit of the Poptop dungeon for flow and narrative
  
  * Asra Nox's shield should repel pretty much all damage now
  
  * moved all Guardians to patch files
  
  * added elemental resistances to the vulnerability script (test)
  
  * You'll now gain Research from performing various actions
  
  * adds some vanity signs from the 'Useless Crap' discord contest.
  
  * adds support for MoiCo mech parts
  
  * since fuel has never been a huge problem for ages...fuel was clearly too good! As a result, all fuel values have been *heavily* adjusted from their previous values. Plan accordingly. You now get the best mileage from crafted fuel types (Bio Fuels, Enriched Rods, etc). Hydrogen is now about the same as Erchius. Isotopes still work, but less impressively by far. Ultronium is still your best option.
_____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.0^reset;   
  
  * Lush planet quest revisions. Targets should properly be pointed to, and you should not be able to complete the quest without first getting a tricorder from Vinj.
  
  * ^red;The Brochure is no longer used to get you to the Science Outpost^reset;. This is instead accomplished by ^orange;completing the intro mission^reset;. You can, however, still spawn the brochure if necessary. It will no longer appear as a reward, however.
  
  * slight edits to some spots in the Poptop dungeon. The boss-area chest should now be accessible, and the kitchen stairs should properly work!
  
  * Poptop dungeon text adjusted to be spoken by Vinj
  
  * removes the Auto-Conversion on teleport from last update (for vanilla Trade Goods) as there are mods that rely on those resources. Sorry guys! You can still Extract them.
  
  * Crew Bed II now requires 1 less titanium to be worth using in place of a single-bed
  
  * corrected some crap you probably don't care about (typos, etc)
  
_____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.5.99^reset;   
  
  ^orange;Game-Start revision^reset;
  
  * I'm testing a little something to rework the game intro. This should at least make certain people are getting to Vinj when they should. This is an experiment, and will likely undergo heavy revisions.
  
  * In addition to the above ^red;there is no longer a Gateway on Lush biome surfaces^reset;. It now, instead, appears inside of the Poptop dungeon.
  
  * new look for Briefcase! (Earth)
  
  * Poptop Dungeon adjustments : removed precursor area. Added Ancient influence instead.
  
  * Stim Rig penalty to food consumption should now be exactly 20% of the default food consumption rate
  
  * Adds a gravity generator for BYOS ships. Has a range of 30 blocks. Also fixes the issue where zero gravity was being applied to racial ships after you selected it until you left the ship. (Hubnester)

  * Renamed 'fu_updateInfoWindow.lua' to 'fu_player_init.lua' (zimber)
  
  * All trade good items (vanilla) are converted to currency on player init (zimber)
  
  * User friendly version: Beaming up/down now automatically converts trade goods into their respective currency so they're compatible with space stations (zimber)
  
  * Increased max trade good currency stacks to 999999 (zimber)
  
  * Removed trade goods from treasure pools (zimber)
  
  * you can now extract existing trade goods should they not convert automatically for any reason
  
  * corrected some food/egg spam on farmable animals and increased urination rate slightly
  
_____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.5.9^reset;   


  ^green;Space Stations^reset;:

  * Trade stations now properly give the bonus you deserve for upgrading them to max level (20). Bonus changed to -5% buy and +2% sell price.
  
  * Trade station buy and sell price change per level is now 5% and 2% respectively.
  
  * Trade stations now properly apply their benefits to their own shops
  
  * Trade stations now display buy/sell rates instead of the bonus they provide
  
  * Adjusted price requirements for upgrading a trading station
  
  ^orange;NOTE:^reset; Any bonuses accumulated so far never existed because I forgot to add them when you upgrade it to max. Sorry.
  
  ^orange;NOTE: Price requirements for upgrading will affect already generated stations after you upgrade them once^reset;.
  
  *Medical Enhancers

    * Better phrasing
    * Hivemind: Shot interval reduced to 1 second, and base damage per shot reduced to 10. (Don't forget its affected by power multiplier)
    * Elemental Repels: Resistance reduction no longer affects physical or negative resistances.
    * Immunization:
      Old effect - Provides the same status resistances Shoggoth armor does, but halves all resistances
      New effect - Provides immunities to most non-weather effects, but reduces overall power multiplier and protection by 10%

  ^green;BYOS^reset;:
  
  * Quite a few QOL improvements for the BYOS system:
  
    * Makes it so that there is ^orange;no gravity or oxygen 'outside' a BYOS ship^reset;. 
    
    * ^red;DO NOT TRY GETTING BACK UP TO YOUR SHIP FROM THE BOTTOM UNLESS YOU ARE USING THINGS TO INCREASE YOUR ZERO G MOVEMENT SPEED SINCE IT WILL NOT WORK^reset;. 
    
    * adds new FTL drive options
    
  ^green;Farming^reset;:   
  
  * Farmable creatures now have a chance to lay eggs. If they are Happy (fed) and their mate time reaches 0 (60 minutes is the base) there is then a 10% chance for them to lay an egg. We'll expand on this later.
  
  * Farmable creatures occasionally urinate, watering tilled soil
  
  * Medical Enhancers will re-apply to the character after leaving the mech. They are NOT active while inside the mech.  (zimberzimber)
  
  * Space Pyramid bottom entrances should no longer hamper mech entry in a frustrating fashion (theobserver) 
  
  * added Growing/Hydro tray support for Ore Plants (voj-tek)
  
  * Pangolin eggs can now be purchased at Terramart
  
  * Fluffalo no longer give all their possible loot every harvest
  
  * Animals emote their food preference when eating. This will help players to identify what foods they prefer.
  
  * Animals poop less frequently
  
  
  ^orange;Miscellaneous^reset;:

  * Primitive Shortspear is properly craftable  
  
  ______________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.5.8^reset;   
  
  * more Healing adjustments:
    
    * moved Honeysilk to the tier 2 medical table
  
    * moved Mutavisk Bandages to tier 2 medical table  
    
    * Honeysilk bandages now heal 120hp over 20 seconds and removes most elemental status effects. 
    
    * Mutavisk bandages now heal 75 hp in 1 second.
    
    * added additional Medkit tiers
  
  * Nanofibres no longer require Mutavisk
  
  * renamed The Frozen Wastes to Delta Freya II, and made it more visually distinct in the missions list
  
  * corrected farm animals dying when eating
  
  * Stimrig Penalties adjusted: Players in Casual mode get a 20% Energy penalty. Survival mode and Hardmode players get 10% penalty and increased food consumption.
  
  ______________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.5.7^reset;   
   
  
  * FU healing items are more on-par with vanilla healing items, often working slightly differently rather than simply being 'better'. None are \"instant\" heals any longer.
  
  * Mutavisk and Honeysilk bandages are much less effective, operating slightly differently than one another in terms of duration/amount healed. Mutavisk heals 80 health over 5 seconds, Honeysilk heals 125 HP over 10 seconds
  
  * The Blood Chalice is suitably reduced in healing

   
  Techs have been *long* overdue for a bit of a rebalance, and this update addresses a few issues with them:
   
  ^orange;Tech Changes^reset;
 
  * Air Dash II speed reduced
 
  * Blink Dash II distance increased
 
  * Magnet Grip II no longer provides an energy boost on gripping a wall. Defense boost remains.
 
  * Stim Rig techs reduced in speed, dash and dash charge time and reduce max energy by 20%. This makes them less of an automatic choice.
 
  * Precursor Rig is no longer impossibly fast and useless (as a result of the above changes to stim rigs)
 
  * Air Dash II speed reduced
 
  * Physics Field II and III utilize more energy
 
  * Zero Burst techs require more energy
 
 
  ^orange;Farming^reset;
 
  * added Iron Trough 
 
  * Chicken Feeder can now feed farm animals
 
  * Well now has +150 max water
  
  * added patches for vanilla cattle in case players have some pre-FU livestock
 
  * default Fluffalos drop both plant fibres and cotton wool
 
 ^orange;Space Stations^reset;
 
 (zimberzimber)
  * Military Space Station:

    * Fixed(?) a bug related to weapons in the shop
    * Weapons now properly show when they're too expensive
  
  * Toxic Cloud (enhancement):
    * Self damage when spawning a cloud reduced from 10 to 5
    * Clouds no longer spawn when on a player ship
  ______________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.5.6^reset;   
  
  * Enforcer armor has been reworked and should now properly function
  
  * corrected Quick Slot bug
  
  * Darkness will now list in the Status window with other Immunities
  
  * corrected baby pangolin evolution typo
  
  * Growing Trays got a bit of a revamp:
    * Fertilizers have been rescoped a bit. There are now more varieties of fertilizer and each has different results on plant growth within a Growing or Hydro tray. Rather than 3 strengths there are now 7!
    
    * Liquid required per phase is increased
    
    * Overall effectiveness of liquid within trays has been reduced
    
    * overall seed consumption increased. You now need at least 3 with basic production, rather than one.
    
    * Accepted fertilizers:
    
      Rotten Food - +1 speed, requires 2 liquid and 3 seeds
      
      Mulch - +1 speed, requires 2 liquid and 3 seeds
      
      Poop - +1 yield, requires 2 liquid and 3 seeds
      
      Fungal Ichor - +1 yield, requires 2 liquid and 3 seeds
      
      Organic Soup - +2 yield, +1 speed, requires 2 liquid and 3 seeds
      
      Elder Fluid - +2 yield, +1 speed, requires 2 liquid and 3 seeds
      
      Fertilizer - +3 speed, +2 yield, requires 2 liquid and 3 seeds
      
      Advanced Fertilizer - +3 speed, +2 yield, requires 2 liquid and 2 seeds
      
      Superior Fertilizer - +2 speed, +3 yield, requires 2 liquid and 1 seed
      
      Reproductive Gene - +1 speed, +1 yield, requires 1 liquid and 2 seeds
      
    * Note that the above details mean exactly what they say: You can *lose* seeds now via using hydro and growing trays if your fertilizer isn't great. You still get seeds back, but as a random variable you won't always get the same as you spent.
   
    * swapped script position for seed / item adding to prevent the seed slot from auto-filling with produced resources
  
    * Hydroponic Tray production speed has been heavily nerfed to encourage fertilizer use. It is x2 speed of the Growing Tray.
  
    * Hydroponic Trays are more liquid-efficient than growing trays
  
  
  


  (zimberzimber)
  
  * Medical Enhancers now last until death instead of lasting for a long time and persisting through death. Cooldown for buying them removed.  If you had a bug from these before, there will be a one-time error if you have an enhancer active, and all your current ephemeral and persistent effects will be dropped.

  * Modified text strings to fit the new change

  * Added some more info the the window popup text  
  
  
  * Medical Enhancers now last until death instead of lasting for a long time and persisting through death.
  
  (kherae)  
  * 3-state cycler ui debug printing removed.
  
  * added special new 'unhandled' category token item. needs a recipe.
  
  * added and edited transferconfig
  
  * transferutil got a minor performance upgrade, and now treats 'unhandled' objects as their own separate category. works well with the token.  
  
  ______________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.5.5^reset;   
  
  * added new farmable pet: Poptops! These are non-aggressive carnivores for your farm different from wild ones, and produce Sharpened Claws. You get your first eggs from Mama Poptop.
  
  * slowed down hunger notifier hearts on farmable pets
  
  * farm animals no longer take random damage
  
  * all farmable pets now have a chance to drop Research when harvested
  
  * starvation indicator should no longer spam insanely fast
  
  * farmable pets now poop, which can be used in a Growing Tray or Hydroponics Tray as decent fertilizer 
  
  * animal diet type and hungerTime should now properly be set in the creatures .monster file
  
  
  (cat2002)
  
  * added trough recognition function to allow other forms of animal trough later 
  
  (kherae)
  
  * corrected some wonkiness in the money transfer device
  
  ______________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.5.4^reset;   
  
  
  * changed Scorchburst alt fire to be less lag-inducing. It now uses a slower fire rate, and a variable projectile time. It gains 1 additional DoT fireball to its spread and uses less energy.
  
  (zimberzimber)
  * ^orange;TEMPORARILY^reset; disabled Medical Enhancer purchases at Medical Stations. We found a crippling bug bricking some folks characters due to SBs handling of persistent effects. this will be adjusted soon.
  
  (missandri)
  * Integration of the Better Crafted Blocks: FU Addon mod into FU itself
  
  (the observer)
  * updated dungeon reward weapons based on user feedback
  
  (cat2002)
  * new farm animal feeding system. Place animal feed in a trough (crafted at the Foraging station) rather than chucking it on the ground. Animals will seek out their food. 
  
  * the above change alters pet bahavior files for farm animals. 
  
  * animals cannot produce their resources unless they are fed and happy.
  
  * Higher animal happiness = higher resource production. Starving animals lose happiness and thus production rates.
  
  * 50% Happiness = 100% production, 100% Happiness = 200% production
  
  * animals have preferred food types. Carnivores will not eat vegetation, while herbivores wont touch meat.
  
  * foods eaten by cattle increase hunger by the food value of the item
  
  * Cattle Feed will only feed herbivores and omnivores
  
  * Cattle Feed is now a Food item
  
  * updated quest for Cattle Feed to reflect these changes
  ______________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.5.3^reset;   
  
  - added mech support for SRW Mechs mod
  
  - Low-tier mech booster speed increased to make it a bit less hazardous with starter mechs. The actual *stats* of the Basic mech parts remains the same. The *modifiers* are increased. This should allow you to avoid things a bit, and move faster than a snail.
  
  ^green;(The Observer)^reset;
  - Added buttons so players who died inside can get into the Green Tower dungeon cap
  
  ^cyan;(Lucca)^reset;
  - ITDs learn another new trick: round-robin within containers! Activate 'Split Slots' mode on the ITD and combine it with output slot settings to split outputs within containers evenly between all valid outputs. This mode won't do anything if there are no output slot restrictions set unless output is inverted. 'Split Slots' stacks with the 'Even Split' mode to combo well with multi-Fission Reactor setups.
  - Fixes the item vacuum bug
  - Fixes the item dupe bug
  
  ^yellow;(zimberzimber)^reset;
  - Modified how questline completion is stored. Note that you *will* get questline rewards a second time if already complete from this change
  - All questlines are saved in one status property as a long string
  - Military space stations now sell the exact same weapon you see in the shop (instead of a re-roll), leveled, and with a price to fit the level
  - Minor popup window modifications
  - Version logging is less misleading to the user
  - Minor handling modifications
  - Added popup window to quickbar   
______________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.5.2^reset;
  
  - Updates the atmospheric condenser to use a more customizable output system and removes the dated variable cooldowns.(Lucca)
  
  - ITDs also learn a new trick: splitting their inputs (more or less) evenly between all output containers! Simply click the 'Even Split' button on the ITD interface to activate this mode, which also respects packet multiple settings. (Lucca)
  
  - Added this popup Update screen (zimberzimber)
  
  - The early implementation of a new Research UI. You cannot currently access it as a player, for there is a lot of work to do on the back end for this update still (research trees, costs etc). But the basics are there for use. (zimberzimber)
  
  - Added ^orange;Space Station Revamp^reset; (zimberzimber): 
______________________________________________________
  ^orange;What do Stations Do Now?^reset;
  
  - The vendor in space stations is now replaced with a console. (you can't miss it) Upon interaction, you will be greated with a new interface through which you'll be accessing the new features. In addition, theres flavored dialogue, and an animated talker! (Currently just a gray AI, but will be replaced with races later, along with race fitting texts)
  
  - Instead of being able to buy one type of goods, and sell only one in a station, you can now buy and sell any of the goods, including new ones!
  
  - In addition, goods are no longer an item and do not take up inventory space, they are currency, acting like pixels or essence for the matter. Goods buy/sell prices depend on the stock of the station.
  
  - If a station has a lot of something, its value will be low, but if they don't have much of it, the value increases!
  
  - Stock also largely depends on the type of station you're visiting. Trading stations have a lot of minerals and will gladly buy electronics, but scientific stations have lots of electronics, and are in need of minerals! Buy for low, sell fo high, and soon you'll be making a nice profit!
  
  - You can now buy/sell things at station shops. The stock is different from station to station, and is themed after the station type! (medical selling stimpaks, military selling weapons, etc...) Some things can even affect the prices in your favor...
  
  - ^orange;Medical stations^reset; let you buy unique, long lasting, persisting-through-death buffs (aka : enhancers) which have strong effects, but also come with some downsides. In addition, you can only purchase an enhancer once every long period of time. But should the effect vore you, you can always remove it at any medical station. Each station has different options to choose from.
  
  - ^orange;Military stations^reset; let you hire a single (per station) crew member. But its not one of your generic 'find person' kind of member, they all pack quite a punch and are definitly worth your time!
  
  - ^orange;Trading stations^reset; accept investments from outside sources, and will gladly shift the shops prices in your favor should you invest enough. If you're super generous, they'll make sure to spread your name across the stars, modifying prices in your favor across all space stations.
  
  - ^orange;Scientific stations^reset; are still in progress. But for now, they turn into another, random station
  
  - Those unqiue, long lasting, persisting-through-death buffs obtained from medical station which I mentioned earlier? Their effects are quite strong, but their downside is heavy as well. Not every enhancers fits every play style, but I'm sure you'll find something you like! You can tell what each enhancer does simply by clicking them in the medical special menu.
