  * reduced Splatoon/Inkliings incompatibility listing to Minor. At worst, you should experience only oxygen related issues.

  _____________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.193^reset;
  
  
  * ^orange;Apiaries^reset; can now be infected with Mites:
  
   - There is a low chance for this to occur, but the chance increases with each additional mite that spawns in the apiary.
   
   - Once mites start breeding in earnest, your apiary will play a sound to inform you of this
   
   - You can kill mites using anti-mite and magma frames, which will work more efficiently in stacks. Max stack size is 300.
  
   - Mites slow (and eventually completely stop) bee production. They are also a pain in the butt to get rid of without the right frames.
 
   - Dead mites have a chance to convert into Bug Shell
   
   - You can feed mites to your farm animals. They suck as food, though.
   
   - More mite changes *will* be coming soon
  

  
  * ^orange;Tray balance changes^reset; and feedback improvements (ProfoundDarkness) :
  
  - Fixed a bug causing perennial seed loss when improving fertilizer.
  
  - Trays are no longer set and forget with perennial plants. Should think of 'Yield Count' as the number of plants being grown. With poor fertilizer choices one should expect seed loss now.
  
  - Perennial growth bonus sticks around from growth ending to the next starting if the same seed. So can pause growth and resume later to still get the bonus (if any defined in seed).
  
  - Hydroponics tray, when powered, is faster than Growing Tray. About the same speed unpowered.
  
  - Some liquid items in the water slot slightly improve growing speed.
  
  - Invalid water/fertilizer items in said slots will be 'rejected' into tray storage if there is room.
  
  - Can interrupt perennial plants starting their next growth cycle the same way as annual plants, by placing any non-seed item in the seed slot.
