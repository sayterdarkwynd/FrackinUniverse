  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.375^reset;
  
  * ammo system refinements, specifically in regard to the bar dissapearing when a certain time has elapsed regardless of swapping weapons

  __________________________________________________

  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.373^reset;
  
  -- Guns --
  * Beam Rifles and Beam Pistols should properly generate their ammo values if they RNG as Ammo based
  * the Mech Gauss Arm now uses the correct projectile firing sound
  
  -- Swimming --
  * Liquid Iron and Lava no longer enable the swimming effect, and instead use default swimming so you can more easily escape its deadly grip
  * Wet effect should no longer 'spam' the drip effect underwater, as it now checks depth in liquid, only playing if in shallow or no liquid
  * Several liquids now have their own 'wet' variant, dripping their liquid when exiting it
  * Water movement should slow you at a greater depth than previous. You should be able to comfortably walk in liquid until your lower chest is submerged.
  * Swim Boost should hit a cap when reaching 250% movement speed in water. This will allow for some stacking, but not to speeds virtually impossible to control.

  -- Crafting --
  * Shadeclaw recipe is more expensive
  * adds Harpsichord (Robur Velvetclaw)
  * D-Hydrogen Phase Core fuel value increased from 5000 to 8000

  * corrected some mis-matched racial SAIL images
  * Thelusian teleporter hitbox set to be 'flat' as the pad of the object, rather than the backing as well

  * added missing intro.cinematic for fupeglaci
  
  -- Misc --

  __________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.372^reset;
  
  * Pretty much any generated weapon should now have at least 1% crit chance, rather than `--`
  * Bouncing Orbitals are no longer insta-gib powerul. They shoot half as many orbs now, and do less damage. Your framerate will thank you.
  
  __________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.371^reset;
  
  -- Misc --
  * rewrote the swimming code. I was too direct in duplicating the method Sock_Bunny used, and have changed how the script handles itself. I've also added them to the Credits file, which I had forgotten. Apologies to Sock_Bunny for any frustration. I should have reached out first.
  
  -- Monsters --
  I'll be tinkering with monsters a bit in the next while, as some just aren't fun. Feel free to chime in on Discord if you have any useful feedback for changes that might be due to specific creatures.
  
  * Rajaflora charge adjusted to be less absurd, making it a more credible threat. It is also now largely unaffected by fall damage.
  * Effigiflora has entirely new actions
  * Bandraflora charge is faster and it is now 50% resistant to electricity
  * Precursor Trifangle primary attacks improved
  * Deathbot and Serpent Droid now fire akimbo shots
  * Rimeling ice trails persist for a shorter time and rise slower. This should make groups of them much more tolerable for lower-end PCs
