  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.285^reset;
  
  
  * Diamond Lantern can now be dyed. (loudwhitenoise)

  * Cellular Armour can now be dyed. (loudwhitenoise)
  
  * Boiler backpack should properly apply its 12% Ice resistance
  
  * fixed an issue where Radiation, Heat and Cold protections were providing immunity to effects beyond their tier. Lesser-level cold, rad and heat immunity no longer block Deadly level.
  
  * Shield bonuses for Health, Energy, Crit, Stun and Shieldbash values now properly apply all the time, rather than only when the shield is raised. This should make Bash much more reliable as well as make the health bonus actually useful.
  
  * all races should have equal chance to spawn as crew via crew contracts
  
  * adds new variants for the BYOS SAIL. One with, and one without, pets. Choose your preference! By default you will have a pet.
  
  * added several new plants by Mr.Pigeon
  
  * added 'upgradeableWeapon' tag to all statted vanilla armors, just so that they have the same options set-bonus FU suits do
  
  * Reduced Veluu Riot Gun damage
  
  (wannas)
  * started on the task of reworking the armour set bonus system. Previously, each armour set had two `.statuseffect` files and two `.lua` files associated with it. I have attempted to abstract as much of the Lua as possible so that each set bonus can be defined with a single `.statuseffect` file.

  * To do this, every (reworked) FU set now adds the stat `fusetbonusmanager` (which runs the `SetBonusManager.lua` script). This reads a config file linking set bonus 'count' stats to the bonus status effects, and applies/removes them as appropriate.

  (Hubnester)
  
  * Removed BYOS objects from the machining table and it's upgrades (except the small FTL drive, warp manifold and racialiser) 
  
  * Removed the unique id from the fu_sciencetechstation and tw_hylotltechstation and renamed them to Science S.A.I.L. Interface and S.A.I.L. Interface 
 
 * Fixed the issue where tw_hylotltechstation was pointing to the wrong location for the scripted SAIL interface 
  
  * Moved some of the the ship component assembler recipes around and changed the category of a few 
  
  * Removed the unique Id from the BYOS techstation (gets given one when spawned during bootup and loses it if broken)
  
  * Added a recipe for the non-decorative BYOS techstation (only difference from the decorative one is that this one comes with a pet (check object description to see which is which))
  
  * Made it so that the BYOS techstation will spawn a pet even if you have a mod like purchasable pets
  
  * Made it so that the SAIL speech after bootup should occur on BYOS ships (and it doesn't cause issues with avali this time)  

  * Makes it so that the racialiser sets a parameter to the object it was racialised to 
  
  * Made the second mantizi in the racialiser race info 'fumantizi' and fixed it's ship pet 
  
  * Overhauls the pet house interface
  
  * Made it so that captured ship pets do not emit capture particles unless set to do so in the monstertype file (to make it so that you can capture them even if their animation file hasn't been patched)  
  
  * Made it so that captured ship pets save their ship pet stats when recalled 
  
  * Made it so that you can despawn a pet houses ship pet using wiring
  
  * Made it so that pets are interactable on a timer instead of never  
  
  * ^orange;If you are using Pandoras Box with the above changes to pets then you will need https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/1649356046 to make the pet house changes work properly until the next Pandoras Box update^reset; 


__________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.284^reset;
 
  * adds the brand new, amazingly cattish Cat race, the Veluuish! Hands down one of the greatest races I've seen yet! (Shinigami Apples, Sentient Cookie)
  
  * adds the majority of Playable Cat data and assets (Sentient Cookie)
  
  * Swapped Eluu hurt sounds
  
  * changed a line of Vina's text regarding slug family gene link

  * heavily altered Kirhosian namegen to be a little less silly
  
  * corrected and updated ship Thrusters (Skies912)
  
  * Monk armor has been rebalanced to suit its tier
  
  * Light Priest and Prophet set bonuses now apply bonuses to quarterstaves
  
  * rebalanced Quarterstaff damage. They should inflict far less, focusing instead on high combo volume
  
  * adds new Rusty and Lab gates (OrangeJuice)
  
  * Fixed item drop for sloped hazard block (thakyZ)
  
  * Orcana mech bodies now support Mass
  
  * Microsphere should properly appear in the Tech Tablet right from the start
  
  * this should make the micro bomb and spider spheres possible to obtain once again
  
  * slightly adjusted Primsatic Staff. It now properly does Cosmic damage, but slightly less overall (from base 40 to base 30 damage, per projectile)
  
  * extracting Nitrogen and Algae together now produces ammonium sulfate
  
  * extracting poop now produces ammonium sulfate
  
  * reduced food value of Lobster and Pests, especially raw, due to their ease of obtaining
  
  * Reduced BYOS atmosphere perimeter to 1000, from 2500. Should reduce lag issues (Hubnester)
  
  * all -crafted- FU spears and short spears count as Hunting weapons. RNG do not. This should make Hunting more viable early game, and a clear alternate to spears and hunting rifles.
  
  * new Lab furniture icons (Ickura)
  
  * extracted Plant Matter is more resource-lucrative
  
__________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.283^reset;
  
  * Reskinned Rot Anglure, and altered name to Rotting Anglure
  
  * fixed and adjusted Slime armor (and all its upgrades) set bonuses
  
  * Precursor Crucible upgrades have had damage bonus increase reduced, providing a smoother gaussian curve
  
  * Rebalanced damage output for RNG Rapiers, Quarterstaves, Longswords and Greataxes. They should be in-line with their same-tier crafted counterparts. They were missed in the last balance pass, apparently.
  
  * Precursor resources have more extraction value
  
  * added Precursor Alloy (non-craftable resource, don't ask how to craft it. You can't.) as an extractable from Precursor Blocks.
  
  * Can now create Precusor blocks using Precursor Alloy
  
  * added recipe for Exotic Matter
  
  * added Kirhos Scythe and Kirhos Striker
  
  * Added an optional new BYOS atmosphere system (toggle-able at SAIL under the Misc category) (Hubnester)
  
  * This new atmosphere system checks if you are in an enclosed room instead of just checking if there is a background tile behind you (Hubnester)
  
  * The enclosed rooms can only have a maximum perimeter of 2500 (which probably allows for a room to be just over the size of a quarter of the ship world (might reduce this if it causes too much lag)) (Hubnester)
  ^red;Note^reset;: Haven't tested how well it handles background checking in very large rooms
  
  * Moar Elduukhar deco (Shinigami Apples)
  
  * Removes fenerox racialiser support to fix issues that this caused BYOS ships (likely due to it being support for a different fenerox race mod)
  
  * Adds a script that can make an object act like a vanilla farmable (currently crops get a new alt form when the crop in unloaded) (Hubnester)
NOTE: Objects that use this script will likely not be considered as a farmable by things that do stuff with farmables (e.g. growing trays) unless they are modified to support this, since they are not actually farmables

  * BYOS crew size can now be decreased (Hubnester)
  
  * BYOS ships no longer take into account the vanilla crew size to stop the crew size from basically doubling (Hubnester)

  * If any crew members left and you increase your crew size they will return (Hubnester)
  
  * You can see the info of inactive crew members and dimiss them at SAIL (Hubnester)

  * along with the above, creatures that evolve will now do so naturally over time, if not fed their required growth item. This means Shadowtops will become Adult Shadowtops, baby raptors will grow into adults, and so on.
  
  * added Megatop. These evolve naturally, but naturally occuring ones cannot be caught. You can, however, mature your own poptop pets to Mega status.

  * added in some oldschool customization additions to novakids from (Beitol)
  
  * added additional colors to novakids , beyond the above (Tori)

  * Checked that it doesn't affect vanilla inventory, or bk3k inventory mod sorting. (OrangeJuice)

  * Allows ITDs to sort by type = ore, but ore is still part of the reagent category. (OrangeJuice)
 
  * Added craftingOre to the categories.config so inventory tooltip just says 'Ore' (OrangeJuice)
 
  * Uranium, Plutonium, Neptunium, and Thorium ore tooltips now say 'Ore' instead of 'Ship Fuel' but still work as fuels in unrefined state. (OrangeJuice)

  * all vanilla and FU races should now have 10k max fuel on default ships. Yay! Parity with BYOS fuel limits!
  
  * Slayer armor set, and stranglevine thorn effects , should no longer proc annoying orange outlines
  
  * Adds crew deeds which increase you crew size by one if you put it in a valid room. Same rules as colony deeds apply and you can interact with them when the room is invalid to get a pop up that says what the issues are.  (Hubnester)

  * Removes the Crappy Crew Bed recipe unlock from being a default one since it's a BYOS only object. It is still a BYOS recipe unlock (Hubnester)

__________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.279^reset;
  
  * added Eld'uu furniture and decorations (Shinigami Apples)
  
  * Precursor Generators now required Antineutronium and Neutronium present before they can function. They will not consume these two resources. (Kherae)

  * renamed Precursor Generator to Precursor Reactor
  
  * hunting should always proc the correct loot when using non-physical damage when applying direct damage. DoT and AoE effects still inhibit this loot.
  
  * added a missing slime lootlist type
  
  * Fixed syntax in the tale of the Nightar Matriarch (AbsoluteZeroX)
  
  * Elder Disruptor Pistol and Disruptor have had some changes made to their function, projectile sprites and feel.
  
  * all Elder weapons now have their own tooltip UI
  
  * Spankr should no longer crash the client on alt-fire due to an oversight in the rework of Radiation Burn
  
  * Lightning Storms are a bit more dangerous, with some strikes leaving electrically charged spots when they strike
  
  * Shock Shrooms have some added punch
  
  * Hurricane weather on Fungal biomes replaced with Fungal Hurricane weather (still displays as Hurricane on navigation map)
  
  * added Electric Storm weather. Creates areas of electricity on the ground that can cause damage as well as stun and electrified status.
  
  * added Static Charge weather. No outward effects, but the air becomes charged with the Electrified status.
  
  * Densinium weapons should all properly count in Densinium set bonuses
  
  * relocated Xi ranged weapons. if your bulb gun mucks up, throw and pick it up again. Should set it right again.

  * X'i armors should properly append bonuses to X'i Bulb regeneration. Their rates have also been increased to reduce the need to camp as often
  
  * added X'ian Pistol nerfed: Damage and knockback reduced. Fire time increased. Now stuns all targets in range.
  
  * added X'ian Acid Gun : able to do a fair amount of damage, its main draw is that it can stick to targets and melt tiles. This allows it to be used for mining.

  * added X'ian Armcannon
  
__________________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.278^reset;
  
  * added Upgrade Table. This functions similar to a Precursor Crucible, or the vanilla Anvil. It upgrades +1 tier at a time, and uses Upgrade Modules. It cannot go higher than tier 6. Items upgraded here do not obtain their 'upgraded skin' if they have one. That requires the previously mentioned Anvil or Crucible. The Crucible remains the top choice for item upgrading.
  
  * Radiation Burn (Rad Burn) has been revised. It now damages Physical Resistance first, and then attacks your health at a much faster rate than previous, but at much lower damage. It also has visual effect changes. No more words!
