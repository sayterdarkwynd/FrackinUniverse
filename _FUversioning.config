  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.235^reset;
  
  * Dark Caverns dungeon entrance on Lush biomes no longer appears in the mines, and instead generates on the planet surface. This should hopefully stop it failing the generate, and allow it to be a bit more interesting to come across.
  
  * Ice Wastes no longer generate the weird 'wtf ice field' terrain type. Dark Ice Wastes, however, still do. This terrain type has been slightly changed, however, and should have a couple variants
