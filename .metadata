  "description" : "GOT A BUG?!?!\nAll error reports will be *much* easier to fix if you provide a link to the starbound.log file (located in starbound/storage/starbound.log) by opening it in a text editor and pasting its contents to pastebin.com, and then reporting with the link to that log. Without an error log, I will be unable to provide much help. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Is FRACKIN UNIVERSE?\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the largest of the mods for Starbound, FrackinUniverse combines new biomes, a hugely increased crafting system, science, monsters, tiles and hundreds of other assets to the game. It's 3 years in now, and quite encompassing. A few things to expect: \n\nExplore dozens of new biomes \n\nCreate hundreds of new armors, weapons and tools \n\nNew monsters await \n\nhundreds of new art assets \n\nnew quest hub \n\nhundreds of microdungeons \n\na massive sprawling eldritch dungeon \n\naffect the world around you by changing tile composition through liquids. Fire rain will scorch the ground, and healing liquid will turn sticky slime into a useful healing agent. Hundreds of possible interactions exist. \n\npower your lab with technological creations designed to make your resource-gathering easier and more efficient. Just be sure to have some generators and batteries to keep them going! \n\nand so very much more! \n\n\nStarbooze, Science and Bees mods are included! \n\n\nNote that your character will no longer possess a light aura in darkness, as darkness is an important part of many parts of FU. \n\nWiki: http://frackinuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/FrackinUniverse_Wiki\n\nCF Forum version found here:   http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/frackinuniverse.2920/\n\nGitHub project version location is here: https://github.com/sayterdarkwynd/FrackinUniverse",
