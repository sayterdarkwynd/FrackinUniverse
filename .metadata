  "description" : "***Disclaimer: Installing FU is a one-way trip. FU will affect your game universe *and* *ALL* characters. If you uninstall the mod, your game will inevitably crash, unless you wipe your universe and player folders. THIS CANNOT BE AVOIDED, so please do not request that we 'fix' this. It is not avoidable. If you are not sure you want to keep this mod, be sure to back up your universe and player folders before installing.***\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nGOT A BUG?!?!\nAll error reports will be *much* easier to fix if you provide a link to the starbound.log file (located in starbound/storage/starbound.log) by opening it in a text editor and pasting its contents to pastebin.com , and then reporting with the link to that log. Without an error log, I will be unable to provide much help.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------- \nWhat Is FRACKIN UNIVERSE? \n---------------------------------------------------------- \n\nPerhaps the largest of the mods for Starbound, FrackinUniverse combines new biomes, a hugely increased crafting system, science, monsters, tiles and hundreds of other assets to the game. It's 3 years in the making now, and quite all-encompassing. A few things to expect: \n\n- Explore dozens of new biomes \n\n- Create hundreds of new armors, weapons and tools that round out the vanilla tiers, or add \"side-grades\" with varied stats but unique stat bonuses, effects and abilities. \n\n- Many new monsters (and many you might recognize!) \n\n- hundreds of new art assets \n\n-new quest hub \n\n- hundreds of microdungeons \n\n- a massive sprawling eldritch dungeon with a hungry, abhorrent boss. \n\n- affect the world around you by changing tile composition through liquids. Fire rain will scorch the ground, and healing liquid will turn sticky slime into a useful healing agent. Hundreds of possible interactions exist. \n\n- power your lab with technological creations designed to make your resource-gathering easier and more efficient. Just be sure to have some generators and batteries to keep them going! \n\n- custom crew members with FU specific buffs to make your adventuring life much easier \n\n- vast array of new effects, both helpful and hazardous \n\n\n\nand so very much more! \n\n\n- Starbooze, Science and Bees mods are included! \n\n(Starbooze - Create your own brew, wines and spirits, and use it to build a kick-♥♥♥ pub!) \n\n(Bees! - Catch, raise and breed bees to create even more types of bees! Get stung! Create bee-related tools, weapons and armor) \n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES: \n\n------------------------------------------ \nFU *will* change several aspects of vanilla play, in terms of survival (see EPP notes below for a specific example) and has a learning curve. Some find the learning curve rather steep. Others do not. So bear this in mind. \n\n\n*Your character will no longer possess a light aura in darkness, as darkness is an important part of many parts of FU. \n\nWalking on certain tile types will produce various effects. Slowed walking in mud, slipping on ice...burning on hot rocks, etc. Be prepared. \n\n\nIf you can't figure out a recipe....build all the basic materials you can. Generally you're likely to be missing something in the progression and inadvertently trying to skip a step. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------- \n\nPLEASE NOTE: We have modified the EPPs in a fundamental way, and there has been a fair amount of confusion about this. The Breathing EPP provides air on airless planets. Radiation EPP protects you against mild (vanilla) radiation. Heating EPP protects you against mild (vanilla) cold. Cooling EPP protects you against mild (vanilla) heat. \n\nThat is ALL they do in this mod. For example, the Cooling EPP does *NOT* protect you against radiation, and it does not provide air in airless environments. \n\nYou're going to have to get more creative to survive in harsh environments. However,FU provides you with many methods of avoiding those hazards. Augments, genetically-engineered produce, armors, and advanced EPPs. All are craftable. \n\nPlay through the mod, work through the techs (including the genetically engineered plants!), and create stuff. Intro-level things unlock other things, and everything builds up until you are a kick-♥♥♥ name-taking machine of destruction and SCIENCE. \n\nIn short: Patience, padawan. Persevere, and you will be rewarded. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------- \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ: How do i tell if its working?\nA: Quite simple. Press C in-game. Do you see \"Come Find Us\" as a craftable item? Yes? Then you're good to go. If you are using a new character, this item also appears in your ship locker. It will begin the FU questhub missions when picked up/crafted.\n\nQ: Will this work on a server?   \nA: Read  :   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=734496146&searchtext=Frackin+Universe\n\n\nQ: How do I run a server?\nA: Read : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=735510285\n\n\nQ:   Do I need to delete my characters and universe before I start? Will it work with the character I already have? (or any possible variation of this question)\nA:   No, you do not. However, you will need to travel a fair ways away on your starmap in order to generate the new biome types. Generally a few seconds will do. So yes, it will work with your existing character. I recommend a clean universe, personally, but that's only if you absolutely want to have FU planets right near your starting location. \n\nQ: I seem to be taking forever to generate my starting planets. It's in warp for like...ever.\nA: Starbound is generating a universe and looking for a starting system that fits exact specifications. Because FU adds so many biomes it increases the time it takes to find the setup. I recommend visiting the Science Outpost when this happens, which can be triggered from your shiplocker items. By the time you come back you'll have your starting planet visible and a quest to begin !\n\n\nQ: Where do I find (ITEM NAME)?!?!?!\nA: Everything has a source. You just need to figure out what that source is. That's part of the mod. Exploration, experimentation...just seeing what sort of things lead to others and eventually ending up with a hard-core science lab. The wiki link given on this page right after the FAQ is a good source of information.\n\n\nQ: Does FU add quests/missions or bosses?\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Does FU affect the main storyline or game progression?\nA: No. The only true mechanic change is with EPP packs (see above sections for info on that). Otherwise you can progress exactly as normal through the base game.\n\nQ: I can't find something on the Wiki\nA: The wiki is player maintained. So, if you find something missing you can feel free to add it in.\n\nQ: My EPP pack isn't working\nA: Yes it is. Read the mod description information above for more details about how they operate now.\n\nQ: Will this run with (my favorite other mods)?\nA: Probably. It is compatible with most mods in starbound but *will* conflict with some depending on what files they alter. But the vast majority will run just fine.\n\n\nQ: I uninstalled and now my game wont work!\nA: You should have read the disclaimer at the top of this page that tells you that this is a one-way ticket. If your character is using FU items, status effects and so forth they will be unusable without the mod present. Likewise, your universe will depend on the biome types and objects within the mod. Silly goof. You should have read!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf for some reason you want to hurl money at me for my labors:   https://www.patreon.com/sayter\n\n\nWiki (player maintained): http://frackinuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/FrackinUniverse_Wiki\n\nCF Forum version found here:   http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/frackinuniverse.2920/\n\nGitHub project version location is here: https://github.com/sayterdarkwynd/FrackinUniverse",
