FU will affect your game universe [u]and[/u] ALL characters.[/b][/h1]\n\nNote: Uninstalling the mod will cause crashes, unless you wipe your universe and player folders. This is not avoidable. Be sure to back up your universe and player folders before installing.\n\n[h2]Frackin Races is not compatible, as it is already included. If you install it as well, you will crash.[/h2]\n\n[h3][b]Incompatible Mods[/b][/h3]\nFor a list of incompatible mods: frackinuniverse.miraheze.org/wiki/Incompatible\n\n[img]http://sayterdarkwynd.github.io/images/fu/bugreport.png[/img]\nError reports will be [u]much easier[/u] to fix if you provide a link to starbound.log file. How to do that?\n[list][*] Go to starbound/storage/starbound.log\n[*] Open that with text editor like Notepad\n[*] Copy and paste its contents to pastebin.com\n[*] Report with the link to that pastebin[/list]\n \n[b]starbound.log helps us to detect what is the CAUSE of your error.[/b]\n\n[img]http://sayterdarkwynd.github.io/images/fu/whatis.png[/img]\n\nThe largest mod for Starbound, FrackinUniverse combines new biomes, a completely overhauled crafting system, science, research, monsters, tiles and hundreds of other assets to the game. Nearly every major game system is changed.\n\n[img]http://sayterdarkwynd.github.io/images/fu/gamechanges.png[/img]\n[b]Major Gameplay Changes[/b] : https://frackinuniverse.miraheze.org/wiki/Gameplay_Changes\n[b]New Races[/b] : https://frackinuniverse.miraheze.org/wiki/Races\n[b]Mech Changes[/b] : https://frackinuniverse.miraheze.org/wiki/Mechs\n\n[img]http://sayterdarkwynd.github.io/images/fu/getstarted.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://sayterdarkwynd.github.io/images/fu/addons.png[/img]\n\n[h1][b]SAIL changes for modded races/ships[/b][/h1] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1411331676  \nor its git link - https://github.com/xn-5o8h/FUSAILModdedRaceSupport\n\n[b]If using *modded* races, you will want the FU BYOS addon here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1194878261&searchtext=FU+BYOS[/b]\n\n[b]Avali Triage[/b] Players will require this: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2052758462 \n\n[h2][b]Recommended Mods[/b][/h2]\nThe following are all top-notch mods we heartily recommend using with FU: https://frackinuniverse.miraheze.org/wiki/Recommended\n \n[img]http://sayterdarkwynd.github.io/images/fu/itemnetwork.png[/img]\n\n[b]For a detailed guide on how to use the included automation systems in FU, refer to this guide-\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1618972523[/b]\n\n[img]http://sayterdarkwynd.github.io/images/fu/faq.png[/img]\n \nQ: How do I tell if it's working?\nA: Quite simple. When you launch starbound, look at the main menu screen. Do you see \"Powered by Frackin Universe\"? If so, you're good to go!\n \nQ: Will this work on a server?\nA: Read : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=734496146&searchtext=Frackin+Universe\n \nQ: How do I run a server?\nA: Read : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=735510285\n \nQ: Do I need to delete my characters and universe before I start? Will it work with the character I already have?\n(or any possible variation of this question)\nA: No, you do not.\nHowever, you will need to travel a fair ways away on your starmap in order to generate the new biome types. Generally a few seconds will do. So yes, it will work with your existing character. I recommend a clean universe, personally, but that's only if you absolutely want to have FU planets right near your starting location.\n \nQ: I seem to be taking forever to generate my starting planets. It's in warp for like...ever.\nA: Starbound is generating a universe and looking for a starting system that fits exact specifications. Because FU adds so many biomes it increases the time it takes to find the setup. I recommend visiting the Science Outpost when this happens, which can be triggered from your shiplocker items. By the time you come back you'll have your starting planet visible and a quest to begin!\n\nQ: Where do I find (ITEM NAME)?!?!?!\nA: Everything has a source. You just need to figure out what that source is. That's part of the mod. Exploration, experimentation...just seeing what sort of things lead to others and eventually ending up with a hard-core science lab. The wiki link given on this page right after the FAQ is a good source of information.\n \nQ: Does FU add quests/missions or bosses?\nA: Yes\n \nQ: Does FU affect the main storyline or game progression?\nA: No. The only true progression change is with EPP packs (see above sections for info on that). Otherwise you can progress exactly as normal through the base game.\n \nQ: I can't find something on the Wiki\nA: The wiki is player maintained. So, if you find something missing you can feel free to add it in.\n \nQ: My EPP pack isn't working\nA: Yes it is. Read the mod description information above for more details about how they operate now.\n \nIf for some reason you want to hurl money at me for my labors: https://www.patreon.com/sayter\nWiki (player maintained): https://frackinuniverse.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page\nCF Forum version found here: http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/frackinuniverse.2920/\nGitHub project version location is here: https://github.com/sayterdarkwynd/FrackinUniverse\n\nA great number of mods and features in FU are from contributors or other authors.
