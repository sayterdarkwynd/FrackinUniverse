  "description" : "***Disclaimer: Any character, while FR is installed, will have the effects for their race applied without prompting you. This cannot be avoided. If you have a character and this mod, they get their racial bonus. Additionally, with FR installed your characters will *require* FR in order to appear at all. Their powers are added by status effects, and Starbound cannot read characters with missing status effects. So if you uninstall FR, you will lose your dudes. ***\n\n\nWhat does Frackin Races do?\n\nWell, Starbound has no racial abilities. This mod changes that. Each race (including many player-made ones) has various abilities. Some are detrimental, while others are great to have. Different playstyles will suit some races better than others, and much more besides. This mod does not add races to Starbound, it merely enhances them.\n\n* does not require FrackinUniverse *\n\n\n\nRacial Abilities can be found here:   http://sayterdarkwynd.github.io/races.html\n\nracial weakness script by Fueledbycancer",
