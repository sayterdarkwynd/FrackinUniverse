    "Created as a means to clean up battlefields, as the very nature of such a cleanup in a multi-species Republic is complex due to the variety of ailments that are capable of cross-species infection.",
    "The virus was once a simple organism, but mutated and gained sentience. At this point it becomes an aggressive prion capable of quantum relocation across dimensional wavelengths through sheer luck. Infecting people, it becomes known as GREG-771",
    "Mutating further, it gets loose. Upon its final mutation it begins to breed sentient parasites. These infect a host corpse, and latch onto its cerebellum as they mature. Once reaching maturty, the Parasite enters a pupae stage and forms a cocoon within the corpse.",
    "It devours the corpse during this transition, leaving behind a slimey outline matching that of the original host. Once this host corpse is digested, the Symbiote is birthed from the slime sack as a fully mature slime.",
    "These are immediately taken in by elder variants who teach them of their new lives and civilization, as their brains are fresh and new. They are fully capable of adult human reflexes from birth.",
    "These new beings are in no way related to the original prion infection. They are not invaders...they simply are born from misery. The poor dears."
