"Aquaculture seems to be the wave of the future. By modifying traditional Hylotl agricultural practices, we have been able to increase nutrient paste output by approximately 200%. Needless to say, this has interesting ramifications for Apex society as a whole.",

"Fish, corals and vegetation work together to produce a superb closed ecosystem with minimal waste and outside inputs. Space is saved, even when one considers standard hydroponic setups. We are confident that in two years' time, ration books will be a thing of the past, breaking the greatest hold the resistance has on the populace.",

"Our only regret is that we have yet to produce a banana variant that will tolerate submersion in brine, but Delta Team appears to be onto some promising results. In the meantime, we suggest increasing allotments of 'I can't believe it's not banana!' banana flavouring to mollify citizens."
