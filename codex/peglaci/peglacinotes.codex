    "The Giants have left traces of themselves across the entire galaxy - many or most have been lost to time or salvage, but you may encounter them in your travels.",

    "The most important thing is to stay calm. The Artifacts are of great value, but they are also almost indestructible - you won't be breaking them by accident, don't worry. If you encounter them, return them to a Peacekeeper outpost for a finder's fee. ",
	
	"Alternately, you may wish to try to use them yourself. You are hereby authorized to try, but we would suggest you be very cautious. Some Peglaci settlements contain a Giant altar - you may have the most luck if you start there."
