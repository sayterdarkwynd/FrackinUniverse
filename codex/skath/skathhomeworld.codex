"Norkumsgath is truly a jewel amongst planets, and we are proud to call it our homeworld. This is where our civilzation started and remains the seat of our political power. It's vast oceans cover about 78% of the planets surface. Most cities and our capital Thela is located on the ocean floor, where our origin is.",
"The ocean floor is illuminated because of bioluminescent vegetation and strange and beautiful sea life. The ocean is also heated by black smokers, heating the ocean floor up to 42 C as an average temperature. This water temperature has given rise to some particularly hardy creatures.",
	
"The surface landscape is heavily covered with rainforests, leading towards inland deserts on the largest landmasses. Both beneath the waves and on land await the bastions of our society, teeming with billions of our kind.",
	
"Unusually, Norkumgsgath does not posess any seasons at all due to a unique rotation and orbit that ensures both sides of the world are always equally exposed to numerous factors. Its moon, Thetala, functions primarily as a spaceport and military factory.",
	 
"Our homeworld is the most heavily guarded world in the entire League, surpassing even Vulis, our greatest fortress world. Experimental antimatter cannons are stationated in orbit as well as on the surface, that rips any cruiser in half in a matter of seconds. Though no one was ever dumb enough to attack our homeworld, we are always prepared for an attack. Better safe than sorry."
