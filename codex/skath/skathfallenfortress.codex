"Recent discussion has led me to believe that the answer to the Skath problem and the Thelusian problem is one and the same. I suggest we find a way to encourage a war between these two species in order to reduce their surplus populations, lest we all suffer the consequences of unchecked growth. We will otherwise choke on their numbers.",
"I realize it is not moral. I also am quite aware that it is necessary, whether we like it or not. I have no urge to wake up next week facing a ten-trillion strong Thelusian fleet in need of food. Do you? Imagine what could happen if left to their own devices? We'd face annihilation at best...slavery at the worst. There is no winning in the face of such numbers."
