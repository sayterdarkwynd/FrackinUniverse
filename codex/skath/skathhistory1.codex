"The Skath originated on Norkumsgath, an ocean world with climate similar to that of the now destroyed Earth. Our ancestors were the apex predators within the oceans and our pack-based hunting strategies quickly led to the development of a society.",
"The first records of our kind were carved in stone in the Tethys Valley, in a region that has always been well inland from the seas. Dating suggests thirty thousand years in the past was approximately the time when Skath first became amphibious. Based on the collected samples, they had a primarily meat-based diet.",
"As society evolved deep below the seas, our attention was drawn to the surface. Not just to claim resources but out of desire for exploration, and it is then then we first discovered the stars and with them...our ability to dream."
