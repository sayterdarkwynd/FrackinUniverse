"The Worker caste forms the backbone of Skathian society and are responsible for literally all of the building and planning of ships, cities and equipment. They are the craftsman and artists, musicians and tradesmen of their people and without them the entire structure of their civilization would crumble. ",
"While looked down upon and mistreated by both of the other castes, the reality is that the Workers are the most important of all. Military and Scientific pursuits are meaningless without the people to manufacture the necessary goods, after all! It is the blood, sweat and tears of the Workers that create.",
"Among the castes of the Skath, the Worker is the lowest rung on the totem pole but also enjoys the greatest amount of freedom. While Vanguard are constantly drilling and training for combat and Seekers endlessly look for knowledge, a Worker completes his task and then relaxes and socializes with others of his kind.",
"This means babies. Lots of babies. Workers outnumber the other castes by a 20-1 ratio, and these numbers are essential if feeding every hungry mouth is to remain a viable goal. It is unfortunate that they are treated as serfs from a pre-industrial society, most barely ekeing out a decent existence on Spawn Worlds. Were they to revolt...they would win by sheer numbers."
