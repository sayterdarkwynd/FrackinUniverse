"Without the discovery of plasma weapons, the Skath would not be where we are today. We owe our very existence to these, our greatest weapons. With them, we fought for our freedom and won. Through them, we have taken worlds. Through them, we shall have more.",
"How does it work, you ask? Honestly, we aren't all trusted with this knowledge. Those among the scientific caste are the ones you need to ask. In the War Caste...we just do the killing. And we do it well. Based on what I do know, I can tell you a tiny reactor generates amplified energy and converts it into the lethal plasmic ejections, not unlike gas converting to fire.",
"The result is a brutal form of energy blast that can melt flesh and bone and decimate anything it touches. It brings fear to our foes, and gains us respect in the cosmic community. Best yet...the bigger we make them, the more other species leave us be."
