"Article 9, Paragraph 3.\nOutcasts\n\nOutcasts are not allowed to enter Skath Territory anymore and only greatly honourable acts will allow them to enter Skath inhabited star systems. To regain his honour, an outcast needs to prove his intentions through action first. If his act is deemed honourable he shall regain his Skath citizenship and is freely allowed to live around his kind again.",

"Should the outcast fail, he must leave Skath space within 1 day or be executed. Officers are under no obligation to keep such Outcasts alive if a verbal agreement is not ratified by a witness, for they have forsaken their honour."
