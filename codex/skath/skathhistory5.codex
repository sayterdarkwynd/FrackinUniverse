"With the discovery of Plasma, our weaponry became extraordinary deadly. All non-scientific vessels were recalled and assembled into a single massive fleet. A guardian to ward off aggression. We were ready for another attack, should anyone try to invade us again.",

"But after we felt safe, our scanners detected a tiny fleet traveling across one of our colonized systems. They weren't one of us and besides...some people were curious about who these interlopers were. A large portion of Skathkind was afraid that these might be Valorian remnants. Thus a huge mistake was made: The mysterious fleet was shot down by Admiral Yethix.",

"After that, everything escalated quickly and we soon found ourselves in open conflict with a new race. These ones called themselves 'Hylotl'. It was, thankfully, short. Another government called the 'Terrene Protectorate' made contact and intervined to stop hostilities.",

"Even many years later, relations remain sour between Hylotl and ourselves, and there is little we can hope for in regards to making amends anytime soon. Not that we have to, really. We have no treaties with them nor any desire for trade with this Protectorate."
