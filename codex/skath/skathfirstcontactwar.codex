"Skath 'history' as we know it goes back only two to three hundred years, at which point it becomes a very different tale...one of sorrow and misery, slavery and death. You see, close to the time they began interstellar exploration the Skath were anxious to meet others in their galactic neighborhood.",
"This eagerness would prove folly, for the nearest species to them (whom they refer to as Volarian, though no record of this species exists in current records) was of a hostile sort and saw only a new food source in the Skath people. And feed they did, with the help of their terrible machines.",
"Unable to compete technologically with the hostile invaders, the Skath ceased all resistance activity within six to nine months (records are spotty on this detail) and simply accepted their fate. And for almost two hundred years they worked as food and slaves, bred for the enjoyment of their oppressors.",
"Underneath the waves, a different sort of resistance had begun. A large contingent of Skath had retreated into the oceans and seas where the enemy was unable to follow (or unwilling, records do not specify either way). Using stolen technology merged with their own, new methods of resistance were devised. All they needed now was a chance to strike.",
"Eventually, the invaders began to stretch themselves too thin in Skath space, and eventually exposed a weakness. It was at this point that the Skath were able to turn the tide with their new Plasmic weapon technology (reverse engineered from that of the invading forces) and reclaim their freedom.",
"Their stories claim the invaders ran in fear, never to return. Based on their narrative, however, it is surmised that in truth the invaders were themselves eliminated by another force entirely. If dating is accurate the chances are high they were in fact the Ghex, recently eaten to extinction by the Xitix-Thelus on the fringes of known space."
