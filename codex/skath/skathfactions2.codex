"Skath appoint the brightest and quickest on their feet as Seekers. This caste, responsible for seeking out new inhabitable spawn worlds as well as knowledge, are the scientific and educational branch of the Skathian people. Without the Seeker caste, all progress would come to a halt.",
"The primary mission of the Seeker caste is the betterment of Skathian life, even at the expense of other lives. Experimentation on other bipedal species is rarely off-the-table (in fact, most research *starts* here for the Skath) and is one of the primary reasons they were not permitted to join the Protectorate. They have instead started the League of Non-Aligned Worlds.",
"Despite their often cruel disposition when it comes to species not of their lineage, the results cannot be argued against. Plasmic weapons, enhanced and nearly limitless energy sources and unique forms of propulsion are all discoveries owed to the Skathian research methodology.",
"Some among the Skath believe the Seekers have one more sacred duty: To seek out and locate the race that attempted to wipe them out not so long ago and bring the vengeance of the Skath against them. These 'Volarians' apparently responsible are unknown to us. The common belief here is that they are another species we already know and they simply haven't seen around."
