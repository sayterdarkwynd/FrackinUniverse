"Article 4, Paragraph 2.
-Obey your superiors.

Those who stand above you have to be respected. Disobeying the commands of your superior gives your superior the permission do punish you in a way they think is appropriate as long as your honour is untouched. If your superior chooses a punishment that touches your honour, you may report it to an officer."
