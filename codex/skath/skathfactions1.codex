"The Vanguard are the military arm and command the fleets and fortress worlds of the Skath. It is without doubt the biggest faction of their kind, due in part to their desire to protect their spawn-worlds. The Vanguard believes that with enough warships and enough defensive measurements, other races will not dare to attack, thus resulting in peace. Unfortunately, this is but a concept...and not how things actually work in practice.", 

"The Vanguards duty is to protect Skath worlds by any means necessary. They also act as some kind of police and the Commanders and Admirals of their fleets have the permission to expulse soldiers, should anyone violate the Codex of War. Of course, these rules are subject to change at a moments notice due to the interference of the Council, and even the most intelligent Admiral is at their mercy when it comes to rule of law.",

"More than one invasion has been carried out under the pretense of 'protecting' their kind, and many more will follow so long as inept leadership is allowed to rule their people. The very nature of their council is corrupt at its root, and the average Skath is ignorant of the extent of this issue. The result is a social heirarchy reliant on unjust and idiotic leaders quite accepting of bribes and general favoritism based on profits.",

"Some have even whispered that the Kirhosi may be partly responsible for this corruption through the promotion of trade markets in Skathian territories, but this is heresay at best."
