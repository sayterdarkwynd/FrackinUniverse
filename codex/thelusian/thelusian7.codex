    "I don't think it is possible for a race to be more industrious and efficient than the Thelusians. While rather dim-witted on their own, as a large group they almost seem to be of a singular mind, and this level of teamwork makes them scary indeed when it comes to warfare. During the defense of their world Crenshaw IX against the Florans, they decimated the opposition in a matter of minutes using constantly shifting formations not unlike moving fractal patterns."
