    "Few species are as xenophobic as these insectoids, and it shows in their interactions with the Protectorate. They prefer to not speak with other races at all if avoidable, but are happy to act as bodyguards and warriors where they typically excel. There may come a day when a Queen chooses to meet with the other races and change the perception of their people, but to date no Queen has ever been seen by the eyes of an outsider."
