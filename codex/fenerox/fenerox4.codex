    "Despite the Uplifting going well (beyond our expectations, in fact), there has been an unintended side-effect. The Fenerox are -insanely- loyal to us. We failed to take into account their particularly unique pair-bonding mechanism their kind practices. It seems that once they imprint, they are unwilling to separate from the target of their bond. Ever.",
    "So, we have permanent attaches that accompany us just about everywhere now. There is a positive to this, thankfully - Fenerox are highly capable hunters and intensely ferocious if their pair-bonds are threatened. This is likely a holdover from eons of unchanged mating habits. As such, we have not been cheated on a deal in over 3 solar cycles. Our profits are up, because nobody wants to risk the wrath of our new 'guard dogs'"
