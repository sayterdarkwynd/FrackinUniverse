    "Primates remind us of rock-murderers from homeworld. Remember, them always in packs and running fast and throwing things, and killing Fenerox for sport? Apex very much alike. Cruel, poking things with sharp metal sticks with juice inside. Claim doctor, but not trust because ape.",
    "Kirhos say this is good, because Apex are murder-monkeys and even poke-juice their own kind to make dumber so can control. Control is bad! Free mind matters. Why not want free-mind? Free-mind is making social better, and social better is making lots of babies. Babies are good to make. Also fun to make. Fenerox quite enjoy baby making."
