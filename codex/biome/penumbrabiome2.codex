"Day 2 - \nBeamed down on this strange planet to find myself surrounded by some of the weirdest foilage -- tree-like plant structures that have big round glowing skyblue bulbs on them, small little flowers that glow with light. I also keep hearing distant sounds, rustling of weeds, but I can't see more than a few feet in front of me, even with a flashlight. I think I'm going to start digging down into the ground, maybe board the exit off behind me. I don't want to get pulled into the jungle by some nasty beast or something."
