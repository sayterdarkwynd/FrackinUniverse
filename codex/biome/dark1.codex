"...The larger question still remains, however: What are Black Stars? How do they fail to generate any real light and yet maintain orbits and gravity...and allow for life in their sphere of influence? None of it makes any sense and there must be -some- sort of sense to it. And yet...conventional physics cannot adequately explain it. Not even Denshubbs Law of Matter can apply to them in full, a fact that still baffles science to this day."
