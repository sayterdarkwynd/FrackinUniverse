    "by K'arn Hollowbeak, Avian scholar
The Clipped Council serve as the bridge between the Flightless and the Stargazers. These martyred Avians were amongst the select few who retained the ability to fly, yet allowed Kluex to clip their wings so as to be able to empathise with his subjects.",

    "The Stargazers rule them, and ferry messages between the council and Kluex through their own powers of flight. Many regard the Clipped Council as the true heroes of Avian society. Willingly sacrificing everything for the good of our species, it is truly a noble pursuit.",

    "The Grounded, however, seem to have a particular aversion to the council, regarding them as corrupt old has-beens, perpetuating some kind of deception. Such paranoia is baseless and damaging."
