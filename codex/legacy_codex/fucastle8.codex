    "King Dreadwing applauded and whooped as the armoured Glitch careened towards him. It was only as the soldier lowered its blade and charged that he suspected something was wrong. The blade pierced his metal shell, which shattered with a deafening crack.",

    "All the Glitch watched as their king fell backwards, his Glitch disguise falling away, revealing a small, black and white bird-like creature. The Glitch had been duped! All this time, their tyrannical, unusual king had been a space pirate in disguise. It made perfect sense. Realising the game was up, and badly injured, the evil space pirate made his escape, never to be seen again.",

    "The rogue soldier turned out to be the impromptu Floran, who had grown bored and decided to go on a hunting spree. She was made an honorary hero of the Glitch people, but then immediately exiled because killing kings is bad, even if they were penguins in disguise. From that day forth, the Glitch vowed never to allow another monarch to take control, even if they asked really nicely."
