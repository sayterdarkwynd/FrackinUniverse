    "All station personnel:
At approximately 2200 hours Earth time this station received an unsecured transmission from USCM Central Command indicating that Earth is currently under heavy attack from a currently unknown enemy.",

    "The transmission did not give any details about the enemy or how the battle was progressing. The only orders given were for all USCM outposts and stations to stay put and await further orders.",

    "I will notify everyone the second we receive any further contact - until then your orders are to stay sharp and prepare for the worst. These coming days may be the most important for us as a species. We all need to be at our best."
