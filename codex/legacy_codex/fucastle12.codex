    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer
Let it never be said that I do not attempt to integrate with whichever hosts I find myself indebted to. I have noticed that when addressing me, the Glitch use prefix words. Examples: 'Dismissive', 'Annoyed', 'Sarcastic' and 'Frustrated'. Feeling as if this is a custom I should celebrate, I have begun to partake in such linguistic frippery myself.",

    "'Delight. It is nice to see you.' I said, but the Glitch just looked at me strangely, and then said something to his friend. I noticed something here, too. When the Glitch address each other, they do not use these prefix words. Perhaps something in their programming means they can read each others' tones without explanation."
