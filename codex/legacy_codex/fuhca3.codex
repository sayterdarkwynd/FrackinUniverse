    "Lost and in need of guidance (the navigational kind, not the spiritual kind), I made my way into an impressive Avian temple. Immediately I felt at peace, like a calm had descended over me. I walked the stone hallways, gazing up at the statues of that giant bird, occasionally greeting priests and worshippers alike. They seemed pleased to see me.",

    "I ascended the temple and grew tired, my weary legs almost giving out after days of adventuring and fleeing. At the top, I found a stone bed. Priests milled about, but they did not seem to mind when I lay down. In fact, they began to cheep and cheer. One of them handed me a delicious, sweet-tasting drink. Soon, I drifted off to sleep."
