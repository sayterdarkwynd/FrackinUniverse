    "I was exploring the ship, as you do, when I encountered what appeared to be someone's private laboratory, marked with 'Keep Out' signs and warnings of delicate, breakable equipment within. I barged my way inside, and began to fiddle with all the exciting bits and bobs.",

    "Imagine my alarm when, from out of nowhere, I was greeted by a dull robotic voice commanding me to 'prepare to die'. At first, I thought the Glitch had finally sent assassins to demand retribution for past transgressions, but the truth was much worse.",

    "A small, misshapen robot stood before me, vibrating on the spot. It looked like it had been made out of a kettle and some saucepans, but its eyes glowed red with malevolence. I knew this was it. Me or the robot. Live or die.",

    "Screaming, I ran from the room, knocking machinery hither and thither. Avians stared at me as I ran through the ship, being pursued by the robot. Nobody even stepped in to help! Eventually I had to throw myself over the side, plummeting down to meet the ground below. Thankfully, the ship was passing over an outdoor Apex marriage ceremony, and the wedding cake broke my fall. A narrow escape!"
