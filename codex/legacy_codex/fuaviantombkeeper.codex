    "by K'arn Hollowbeak, Avian scholar
Tomb Guards are regarded by other Avians as weird or creepy. The reason for this is because they willingly volunteer to live in a tomb for ten years. What others don't realise, though, is that being a Tomb Guard gives one plenty of time to reflect, to create, to plan. Some of my best works were prepared during my tenure as Tomb Guard.",

    "Tomb Guards also have to possess exceptional physical and mental skill. While it's never been documented in Avian history, it's entirely possible that a large armed group could descend upon a tomb, set on stripping it of its riches. As such, we spend many years reading up on how to deal with such a situation, until we feel we're ready for anything."
