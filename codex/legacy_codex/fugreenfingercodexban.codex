    "Town elders have informed me that celebrated author Treeio Florstab has fled his home village after a series of critical maulings in the intergalactic press. His writing tutor, one Glitch Professor Irondome, was found with a copy of Florstab's debut novel, Floran Peace, rammed into his mouth.",

    "Thankfully the Glitch was okay, although I'm told he occasionally quotes pretentious dialogue following the incident. Florstab apparently told the Glitch professor that he'd make sure the universe would 'remember my name.'",

    "As such, I have no choice but to suspend any and all attempts at teaching the Florans to write, in case we encounter any further murderous delusions of grandeur."
