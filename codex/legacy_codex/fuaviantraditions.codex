    "by K'arn Hollowbeak, Avian scholar
It is common for some of the richest Avians to be buried with their worldly possessions. I have always found this a strange practise, but it transpires that many other species do the same. As a historian, it seems a shame to me to seal away sometimes-unique items, but I do also see the romanticism in being able to take your treasured things into the afterlife.",

    "However, because of this trend, Avian tombs are often the targets of robbery, hence the employment of Tombkeepers, individuals who dedicate their lives to living in the tombs for a period of no less than ten years."
