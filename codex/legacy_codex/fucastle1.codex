    "by Greenfinger of the Florans
Ever since our two species came together, the Glitch have been a source of intrigue for me. The Hivemind Glitch remind me of our people in many ways; singularly driven, focus on teamwork. And yet the Florans work as a unit through choice, but the Glitch appear connected to some kind of central mainframe. A sentient AI, perhaps? Or something else. The truth has been lost to history. Nonetheless, it is remarkable to consider that in this way, the Florans far outmatch the Glitch in terms of societal advancement.",

    "It is the Outcasts who interest me most. Many of these free-thinking Glitch have come into our midst. Their physiology means they have little to fear from the Florans, but there is more than that. There is an affinity between the two species, of which there is no denying."
