    "Any visitor to a Floran village will be greeted with a single reassurance; it is Floran custom not to harm any guest who enters a Floran home patch.",

    "This is, of course, a lie.",

    "Perhaps the intention was to be hospitable, but the Florans are incapable of sticking to such things, quickly descending into lethal violence if their guests should offend them in some manner. It is also worth noting that it is exceptionally easy to offend a Floran. Examples include: refusing to eat raw meat, damaging the plant life, being a Hylotl."
