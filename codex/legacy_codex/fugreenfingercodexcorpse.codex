    "The Avians have perpetrated a wonderful deception. The rumour that the corpses of their gods - their gods! - rest in their tombs has spread throughout the universe. Such rumours attract looters, and said looters make for a handy, never-ending source of live sacrifices, to use in their silly rituals. It is genius, even by my standards.",

    "Of course, the corpses of the Sunborn do not rest in random tombs. They are hidden away, together, in a place known to a select few. If all goes well, that information should be in my possession in due course. I would very much like to study the biology of a god."
