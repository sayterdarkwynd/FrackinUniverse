    "We have tolerated the Outcasts at a distance, with the understanding that they do not infiltrate our most precious of sanctums; our castles, our homes, our underground fight clubs. Outcasts have infiltrated all these places. They loiter around, saying words, and having opinions. It is disconcerting and disruptive.",

    "Our goodwill can only last so long. They are corrupting many of our number and severing their link with the central consciousness. As such, any Outcast spotted in a designated safe zone must be immediately arrested and sent to the laboratories for repurposing."
