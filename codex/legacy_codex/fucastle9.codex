    "The army paraded past on floats, towed by a number of Glitch workers and a Floran who'd decided to join in unannounced. Dreadwing sat atop his iron throne, brought outside into the city, and applauded each and every unit. 'They stand very still,' he remarked, to which his aides replied 'yes, they are very disciplined.'",

    "As the last float made its way down the street, the entire crowd gasped as one of the soldiers leaped from the stand, and charged towards Dreadwing. Most surprised of all were the blacksmiths, who knew full well that their 'soldiers' were little more than decorative suits of armour. Dreadwing, however, thought it was all part of the show."
