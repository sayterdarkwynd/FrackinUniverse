    "Greetings, intrepid space explorer. Don't ask who we are, or how we've found you. You're better off not knowing. We'll get straight to the point. Mushrooms. Mushrooms are taking over the galaxy. Agarans, to be precise. I'm sure you've seen them, waddling about, making their terrifying pods, yelling in unknown tongues. What you may not be aware of is just how dangerous they are.",

    "We, an unknown organization in no way associated with Thornwing or Big Ape, are attempting to translate their speech patterns and quell their uprising. And that's where you come in. We need you to get close to the Agarans, to study them, to hit them with heavy weaponry until they surrender.",

    "To aid you in your unsolicited mission - which we are very grateful for, of course - we have provided you with a foolproof Agaran disguise that will let you get close to these vile fungi. Wear it, or don't, it's up to you. Oh, one thing. We've heard talk of giant pods appearing around the galaxy. Maybe avoid those, leave them to the experts."
