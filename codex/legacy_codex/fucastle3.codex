    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer
The Glitch may not be the warmest of people on the outside, but their hospitality is undisputable. They found me scaling the castle wall, simply wanting to have a look through a tower window, and politely invited me inside. Now, of course it sounded like a trap, so there was a bit of a scuffle at first, but it turned out they were genuine.",

    "They offered me the run of the castle, to explore, research and investigate to my heart's content. Occasionally I run into one of them and they greet me pleasantly enough. I have been reading all manner of fascinating books, and my understanding of the Glitch is growing."
