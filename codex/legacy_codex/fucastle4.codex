    "Once upon a time, before the dawn of the Outcasts, all the Glitch lived peacefully together. They had their villages and castles and fields and all sorts of other things that robots like. They lived happily and prosperously, thousands of minds working together. But one day, a single Glitch walked into the castle, took a seat on the throne, and loudly proclaimed; 'Decisive. I am the king.'",

    "The other Glitch stared at this unusual sight for a while, but did not know what to say. A self-proclaimed ruler was not something they were prepared for. As such, and with no real understanding of the situation , the Glitch were forced to obey."
