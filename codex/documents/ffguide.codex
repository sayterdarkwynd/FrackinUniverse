"^green;Introduction^white; - So, you fancy yourself a botanist? A scientist? Chemist? Whatever the case, you've a long road ahead of you. This guide will brief you on what you need to know to play with Frackin' Universe effectively.",

"^green;The Matter Assembler^white; First you need to figure out how to make a Matter Assembler. You'll need this to produce most of your lab equipment. You can find this station on your ^orange;Inventor's Table^reset; right from the start of your game.",

"^green;The Extractor^white; - Next, you'll need an Extraction Lab. These machines are invaluable to any budding bio-engineer. You just toss whatever it is you want to pull materials from into it, press the buttons and BAM! Goodness comes out. I do however recommend against putting live creatures in there. Kittens extract poorly.",

"^green;Extraction^white; - You'll typically get one of a few things when extracting. Nutrient Paste, Tissue Cultures, Raw Minerals, or Genetic Material. All have their uses, and you will definitely need many of each. Material outputs vary greatly, however, and you may find yourself with exceptionally more valuable resources.",

"^green;Finding Resources^white; - Genetic Material is most commonly found in meats, certain plants and similar stuff. You'll find Raw Minerals in stone, ore and other things rich in mineral content. Tissue Culture is most common from plants, seeds and produce. Nutrient Paste is common in most soils.",

"^green;Methanol^white; - Methanol is an important resource for several goods. Where it's found is pretty straightforward. Cut down some trees. Extract from the wood in your extractor. Simple as that!",

"^green;Mining^white; - You probably don't want to do much hard work. You're a science guy, after all right? Tough cookies. Get your matter manipulator and start digging (or build a Basic Miner in the Matter Assembler). Otherwise you'll never find what you need. ",

"^green;Lab Space^white; - With your Matter Assembler placed, you are probably starting to realize that you will need a substantial amount of space for your lab. Any self-respecting scientist would make room for such a glorious thing! Who DOESN'T want a lab?!?! But I get ahead of myself here...You'll be able to create several more stations now.",

"^green;Bio-Chemistry^white; - The BioChem Lab is your all-in-one chemistry station. Any sort of tinkering involving formulas is done here. Likewise, you can produce some more...interesting things. Such as unstable particles for use in energy weapons. The BioChem lab is absolutely essential to your continue success and survival.",

"^green;Plastic and Silicon pt 1^white; - To make some products, you'll need Plastic. In order to make Plastic, you first need to get some silk. ^orange;Bracken Trees^white; shed silk, as do moths. Alternatively, Spider Silk extracts quite well into silk should you find any in your travels.",

"^green;Plastic and Silicon pt 2^white; - Silicon is easier to come by, since for the most part you need only extract sand for it. Some sands produce a a bit more and as such you'll want to experiment.",

"^green;Xeno-Research Lab^white; - Now you'll need a Xeno Research Lab. This sweet baby will produce various sorts of genes. With these, you can create plants by combining the goods in a Gene Design Lab. That's next. First, build yourself the Xeno Research Lab.",

"^green;Designing Genes^white; - The Gene Design Lab is your best friend. Here, you combine all the things you've made in previously built stations in order to create new seeds! Hundreds of plant types await.",

"^green;Storing Your Goods^white; - Need somewhere to store the dozens of resources you're inevitably going to create through your research? Well, the solution is simple enough: Gene Cabinets. Build a couple of these and you will be good to go. They're cheap and easy to make!",

"^green;Fertilizer^white; - A large portion of recipes for research or plant seeds will require Fertilizer in order to be created. That means you'll need a myriad of materials. There are varying strengths of fertilizer, and some plants will require the more advanced forms. ",

"^green;Caliche^white; - Caliche stone is extremely useful, producing both saltpeter and iodine. You'll need both. Finding Caliche can be tricky if you don't know where to look. Check deserts, they typically have a lot.",

"^green;Other Labs^white; - You've only just scratched the surface, and there are over a dozen additional labs that can increase productivity, output and so very much more. I recommend trying everything, but you'll definitely want an Armory, Clothing Fabricator and Nanofabricator."
