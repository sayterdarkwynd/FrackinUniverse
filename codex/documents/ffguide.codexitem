    "For an incalculable amount of time, the Apex dreamed of a destiny promised to us, a whispering from the stars which spoke of a greatness beyond the constraints of our natural form. Bound by our DNA to lives of mediocrity, we persevered inconsequentially in our quiet corner of the universe.

Then came the day when the Miniknog was formed - The greatest minds of our people united together to further the most important research in scientific history.",
"When a devastating plague struck, the discovery of the cure came with a most unexpected side effect. The Vestigi-Evo Process, or VEP, was invented - Trading physical devolution for intellectual evolution.

The VEP allowed us to become the race we were destined to be. With our advanced intellect the Apex spread efficiently throughout the universe, becoming an active presence in the galactic community.",
"Under the guiding hand of the Miniknog, enough resources were gathered to provide housing to our entire population, rich and poor.

To this day the Miniknog are committed to their valiant research. Perhaps they will one day restore the lost physical identity of the Apex of old. "
