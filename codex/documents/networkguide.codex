		"You will find Customizable Automatic Transmit Network devices primarily at the Machining Table. The parts are connected by wiring, but Cat Net is decentralized. If there is a power input mentioned on the label, you can toggle it with a switch. Most important: If cat left labeling on it, read the label!",
		"ITDs handle item movement while turned on, across storage and other connected devices.\nSet your filters before wiring in and outputs. Choose your In- and Outputs carefully.",
		"The Storage Bridge looks for the container nearest to itself, measured between bottom-left corners. They only relay info about their container. Just plug them into any CAT Network devices.",
		"Pump and quarry work out of the box and automatically collect. A Quarry extends up to 20 blocks to the right, then mines in that area downwards (amount based on tier, current depth limit is about 200 tiles). Pumps automatically go down until they find a fluid, up to the same distance. When full, they just offload near the device.",
		"Quarries will pick up any items in their way, including chests. Secondary makes it mine background tiles.\nThe second mode for the pump switches it to compress liquids and pump them to any connected spouts.\n",
		"The Terminal lets you retrieve items. Grabber (Foraging Table) picks things up. The spout ejects any liquids and accepts them from pumps.",
		"The current ITD interface has 2 functions, the slot filter and the item filter. The input slot filter, let you pick which slots to take from. Output slot filtering is included. \nTo filter items you need one to base the filter on. On default, only that item is transmitted Inv. Logic takes the condition out, inverts it, and makes it a logical AND. In other words, it excludes that item from transmit. There's also filtering for Exact Match, Type Match (Item Category), and Category Match (Groups of Categories).",
		"Item Categories: \nGeneric: junk, anything that doesn't fit a category. \nTreasure: Anything shiny or rare. \nMaterials: block, liquid, platform, breakables! \nRail stuff: rail, railplatform, railpoint \nconsumable: the food category. \nbooks: blueprint, codex \nReagents: materials, ingredients, fuel \nbuilding: storage, crafting, electronics, furniture, doors. \nFarm beast and tree stuff \nWeapons \nArmor",
		"Tools: tools, instruments and throwables \nAugments: epp augment, fishing lure, fishing reel, pet collar, clothing dye",
