"^green;Subbiomes^white; - In addition to main biomes, FU also adds very many subbiomes. These can happen on any world, and are typically fairly random (within reason). A few examples are:",

"^green;Badlands^white; - You won't find much in terms of plant life here, but you will find ore and minerals. There are most common in deserts.",

"^green;Blisterbush Field^white; - Well, this is one way to stock up on blister pods on the fly. Useful. Most common on Proto Worlds.",

"^green;Bloodstone Field^white; - Much like the planet type, Bloodstone Fields are downright strange.",

"^green;Caliche Field^white; - a great place to stock up on Iodine and Saltpeter by way of Caliche.",

"^green;Hellfire Field^white; - You'll find tons of Hellfire plants in these small regions. Oh, and lava.",

"^green;Irradiated Waste^white; - Essentially the same as their planet-size selves.",

"^green;Lava Lake^white; Lava. That's...pretty much it.",

"^green;Meadow^white; - Flowers. Lots of flowers.",

"^green;Wasteland^white; - A dead expanse of nothing fun or happy. Don't smile.",

"^green;Pitch^white; - Pitch regions are full of heat, tar and bones. The upside is that they provide abundant oil.",

"^green;Primeval Forest^white; - Ancient forests loaded with massive trees. A very useful place to stock up on wood.",

"^green;...and several dozen more!^white; - There are quite literally dozens of other micro biomes to be discovered, loaded with useful resources for your studies. Keep alert and explore!"
