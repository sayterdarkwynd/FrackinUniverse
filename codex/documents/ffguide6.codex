		"FrackinUniverse adds a large amount of armors (and foods) and enhances some older ones, allowing for a greater variety of playstyles. These can be very useful through gameplay and provide exceptionally useful benefits!\n
^orange;Stats^reset; : Vanilla players may notice there are more than they are used to, and even the ones they are used to have different ranges. FU presents a wider variety of armor classes to spice up your play, and does the same with food.\n
If you are more interested in damage, pick up Power armor or hyper power armor to trade defensive stats for offensive ones. Alternatively, pick up Tank or Power Tank sets to outlast your enemy. They come in melee OR ranged! Fighting not quite your thing? Pick up an Exploration oriented set, and be at home in your environment! You're guaranteed to locate a set that suits your playstyle somewhere out there!\n
^orange;Resistances^reset; : Many armors in FU come with inherent resistances. Many biome weather effects will simply stop affecting you once you hit an appropriate amount, and various enemy attacks will do less damage. Nifty, right? It gets better; upgrade your armor, and those resistances will increase!\n
^orange;Bonuses^reset; : Most are increases to your stats, plenty are conditional. 
Any that say ^green;+value^reset; are typically additive increases. It can be a little confusing, however. As example: if it gives +^green;3^reset;% Crit Chance it increases your crit chance by a flat 3%, but if it says +^green;3^reset;% Energy Regen, that's 3% of your base. The easiest way to remember is to ask yourself...does it have a base of 0? If so, it likely is like Crit Chance! If a bonus says x^green;1.3^reset;, or ^green;More^reset;, that's a multiplier on the value you currently have. Have 1000% Damage somehow? 100% More (or 2x) would make it 2000%! Small note: Regen is usually per second.\n
Of course, some bonuses have hidden components we couldn't easily include, for tooltip space.\n Additionally, there are some other phrase uses to note. If a set bonus states that it grants immunity to ^green;ALL^reset; of a related effect, that typically means all biome weather ^orange;as well as^reset; specific status effects related to that element. For heat, that includes burning and even lava! For radiation, that includes rad-burn.
As a small side-note, some terms or symbols are used loosely. If you see a bonus with x/y, that means the bonuses are different based on how their conditions are met. For weapons, this means how many of that type.\n
^cyan;Mining Sets^reset; :\n Mining laser sets grant a lot more mining laser damage...but that bonus is reduced significantly if you are pairing them with something else. Using a mining laser with a pistol, as example: 2x Mining Laser Damage becomes 1.25x.
^orange;Colors^reset;: Colors are important in set bonuses. If something is ^green;GREEN^reset;, that means it is a good thing. ^red;RED^reset; means it is a bad thing. ^cyan;Cyan^reset; is for things that are binary. They typically do not stack with similar effects. This will be especially apparent with damage boosting foods...so choose carefully. It is worth noticing that there is ONE exception to the rules regarding colors: Glow. If you see Glow in a color, that is usually the color of the glow effect.\n
^orange;Special Bonuses^reset; : Some sets have special bonuses that don't really display much information due to lack of space, an unfortunate limitation of the game.. Here, some bonuses will be explained.
^cyan;Auto-Medic^reset;: More complicated than straight regen, this effect will restore more health per second at the cost of an equal percentage of energy.\n
^cyan;Thorns^reset;: a nova of thorns when hit, ^cyan;Fire Burst^reset; makes a nova of fire instead.\n
^cyan;Summons Minions^reset;: summons short-lived allies to fight alongside you or distract enemies. These minions scale based on the lowest armor's tier, so upgrading it is essential! Upgrade ALL of the pieces.\n
^cyan;Life/Energy Shell^reset;: Gain damage absorbtion based on your resources to protect your health. Regenerates quickly if you haven't taken damage recently. ^cyan;Shell Immunities^reset; are granted only while the shell holds. The numbers specified refer to, in order: The capacity of the shield relative to the resource, the regeneration rate, and the delay upon taking damage before it begins regenerating.\n
^cyan;Gravity Normalization^reset;: Personal gravity too low? Up it goes. Too high? Down instead. Exception: Zero-gravity.\n
^cyan;Vital Power^reset; and ^cyan;Juggernaut^reset;: these effects are set bonus exclusive, and quite powerful; they grant one stat based on a percent of another. Vital power grants power as life, Juggernaut grants life as power.\n
^cyan;Undying Resolve^reset;: increases Protection as your life gets lower, up to the stated amount, while ^cyan;Immortal Resolve^reset; grants HP Regen instead. If a set grants either, it will grant ^cyan;Immortal Resolve^reset; to your pet.\n
^cyan;Dark Commander^reset;/^cyan;Beast Master^reset;: Increases Damage, Protection, HP and Speed of your pets (both) and crew (Dark Commander) by the listed percent, increases their jump ability by half of that, and regenerates HP at a sixth of that amount per second.\n
^cyan;Capturenaut^reset;: Increases pet count by 1, plus an additional 1 per 2 tiers of the lowest equipped set piece. Grants an additional +1 if using alongside the back item. This means a fully upgraded set will allow up to 5 additional pets!\n
^cyan;Charisma^reset;: Your ability to bargain with Traders at space stations. The higher your charisma, the better the deal (and fatter your bank balance!)\n
They will inherit more stats from you, both beneficial and detrimental, and have special scaling on Protection and HP. Be mindful when taking powerful buffs like ^cyan;Glass Cannon^reset;, as it will reduce their health noticeably.
^cyan;Pet Stat Inheritance^reset; is as follows: HP, directly from your character, rather than just equipped armor, and increased further by your Protection stat. Protection: Inherited from armor as in vanilla. Damage: directly from character sheet. Health Regen: Inherits as a flat amount, except in special cases (^cyan;Immortal Resolve^reset;, effects not covered by FU, etc.). If you have 100 health and 10% HP Regen, it will grant your pet 10 HP per second. If a stat isn't here, a pet most likely does not inherit it."
