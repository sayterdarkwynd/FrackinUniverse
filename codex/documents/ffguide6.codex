		"FrackinUniverse adds a large amount of armors (and foods) and enhances some older ones, allowing for a greater variety of playstyles. These can be very useful through gameplay and provide exceptionally useful benefits!\n
^orange;Stats^reset; : Vanilla players may notice there are more than they are used to, and even the ones they are used to have different ranges. FU presents a wider variety of armor classes to spice up your play, and does the same with food.\n
If you are more interested in damage, pick up Power Armor or Hyper Power Armor to trade defensive stats for offensive ones. Alternatively, pick up Tank or Hyper Tank sets to outlast your enemy. They come in melee OR ranged! Fighting not quite your thing? Pick up an Exploration oriented set, and be at home in your environment! You're guaranteed to locate a set that suits your playstyle somewhere out there!\n
^orange;Resistances^reset; : Many armors in FU come with inherent resistances. Many biome weather effects will simply stop affecting you once you hit an appropriate amount, and various enemy attacks will do less damage. Nifty, right? It gets better; upgrade your armor, and those resistances will increase!\n
^orange;Bonuses^reset; : Most are increases to your stats, plenty are conditional.
Any that say ^green;+value^reset; are typically additive increases. It can be a little confusing, however. As example: if it gives +^green;3^reset;% Crit Chance it increases your crit chance by a flat 3%, but if it says +^green;3^reset;% Energy Regen, that's 3% of your base. The easiest way to remember is to ask yourself...does it have a base of 0? If so, it likely is like Crit Chance! If a bonus says x^green;1.3^reset;, or ^green;More^reset;, that's a multiplier on the value you currently have. Have 1000% Damage somehow? 100% More (or 2x) would make it 2000%! Small note: Regen is usually per second.\n
Of course, some bonuses have hidden components we couldn't easily include, for tooltip space.\n Additionally, there are some other phrase uses to note. If a set bonus states that it grants immunity to ^green;ALL^reset; of a related effect, that typically means all biome weather ^orange;as well as^reset; specific status effects related to that element. For heat, that includes burning and even lava! For radiation, that includes rad-burn.
As a small side-note, some terms or symbols are used loosely. If you see a bonus with x/y, that means the bonuses are different based on how their conditions are met. For weapons, this means how many of that type. If you see something like (Machine) Pistols, that means the bonus applies to Machine Pistols OR Pistols. This is typically done for tooltip space.\n
^cyan;Mining Sets^reset; :\n Mining laser sets grant a lot more mining laser damage...but that bonus is reduced significantly if you are pairing them with something else. Using a mining laser with a pistol, as example: 2x Mining Laser Damage becomes 1.25x.
^orange;Colors^reset;: Colors are important in identifying and understanding bonuses. To start with, set bonuses are identified by a ^yellow;^reset;, while a ^green;^reset; is only visible in crafting interfaces to display resistances. If a bonus stat is ^green;GREEN^reset;, that means it is a good thing. ^red;RED^reset; means it is a bad thing. ^cyan;Cyan^reset; is for bonuses that are binary. They typically do not stack with similar effects. This will be especially apparent with various foods...so choose carefully. It is worth noticing that there is ONE exception to the rules regarding colors: Glow. If you see Glow in a color, that is usually the color of the glow effect.\n
^orange;Special Bonuses^reset; : Some sets have special bonuses that don't really display much information due to lack of space, an unfortunate limitation of the game.. Here, some bonuses will be explained.
^cyan;Adaptive Armor^reset;: Applies a defense multiplier that scales between the two listed values as your health moves between 10% (left) and 100% (right).
^cyan;Auto-Medic^reset;: More complicated than ordinary regeneration, this effect will restore more health per second at the cost of an equal percentage of energy. It will also decrease energy regen and increase energy regen lock-out multiplicatively at 2x the heal percent.\n
^cyan;Thorns^reset;: a nova of thorns when hit, ^cyan;Fire Burst^reset; makes a nova of fire instead.\n
^cyan;Summons Minions^reset;: summons short-lived allies to fight alongside you or distract enemies. These minions scale based on the lowest armor's tier, so upgrading it is essential! Upgrade ALL of the pieces.\n
^cyan;Life/Energy Shell^reset;: Gain damage absorption (shell) which scales based on your maximum resources (health, energy) to protect your health. Regenerates quickly if you haven't taken damage recently. ^cyan;Shell Immunities^reset; are granted only while the shell holds. The numbers specified refer to, in order: The capacity of the shield relative to the resource, the regeneration rate, and the delay upon taking damage before it begins regenerating. Special note: Due to balance concerns, Energy Shell has a minimum lockout time of 0.5 seconds, and a maximum regen rate of 50% per second.\n
^cyan;Gravity Normalization^reset;: Personal gravity too low? Up it goes. Too high? Down instead. Exception: Zero-gravity.\n
^cyan;Vital Power^reset; and ^cyan;Juggernaut^reset;: these effects are set bonus exclusive, and quite powerful; they grant one stat based on a percent of another. Vital power grants power as life, Juggernaut grants life as power.\n
^cyan;Undying Resolve^reset;: increases Protection as your life gets lower, up to the stated amount, while ^cyan;Immortal Resolve^reset; grants HP Regen instead. If a set grants either, it will grant ^cyan;Immortal Resolve^reset; to your pet.\n
^cyan;Dark Commander^reset;/^cyan;Beast Master^reset;: Increases Damage, Protection, HP and Speed of your pets (both) and crew (Dark Commander) by the listed percent, increases their jump ability by half of that, and regenerates HP at a sixth of that amount per second.\n
^cyan;Capturenaut^reset;: Increases pet count by 1, plus an additional 1 per 2 tiers (up to +2) of the lowest equipped set piece. Grants an additional +1 if using alongside the back item. This means a fully upgraded set will allow up to 5 additional pets!\n
^red;Wretchel Toxicity^reset;: Ingesting Wretchel reduces core stats and healing received, and drains health over time. These effects increase in severity the more you consume in a short time frame, as well as while your health is critically low. It will ^red;KILL^reset; you, if you are careless.\n
^cyan;Charisma^reset;: Your ability to bargain with Traders at space stations. The higher your charisma, the better the deal (and fatter your bank balance!)\n
\n\n^cyan;Pet/Crew Stat Inheritance^reset;:
Overall scaling is as follows: HP, directly from your character, rather than just equipped armor. Protection: applied as a multiplier to HP via a specific formula. Damage: directly from character sheet. Health Regen: Inherits as a flat amount, except in special cases (^cyan;Immortal Resolve^reset;, effects not covered by FU, etc.). If you have 100 health and 10% HP Regen, it will grant your pet 10 HP per second. If a stat isn't here, a pet most likely does not inherit it.
^yellow;Special notes^reset;: Be mindful when taking powerful buffs like ^cyan;Glass Cannon^reset;, as it will reduce their health noticeably.
