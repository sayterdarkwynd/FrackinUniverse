   "I. \nThis is a HowTo in two parts. The first is designed to help you set up the 2 kinds of networks used (primarily ^orange;StarTech^reset;). The second will show you how to actually incorporate them into your game. \n^orange;Both chapters include StarTech^reset; (recommended in addition to FU - Mass Storage and Transport as described in the following pages will not work without it). \nFirst unlock Wiring Mode on your M.M. or the ^orange;Mechanics' Wrench^reset;, crafted at the ^orange;Electronics Center^reset;.",
   "(a) To set up a ^green;Basic Network^reset; you will need ^cyan;any container^reset;, to store your stuff in, and 3 items found at the ^orange;Inventors Table^reset;. The ^orange;T(ransmatter) Controller^reset;, a ^orange;T Storage Bus^reset;, the ^orange;T Terminal^reset; and a ^orange;Relay^reset;. You can also craft a ^orange;T Drive Bay^reset; and a ^orange;Storage Drive^reset; for later.",
   "Place the ^orange;Storage Bus^reset; above your container so that the cone points towards it. If you don't want the Bus, equip the ^green;Wrench^reset;(Anvil) and left-click. Leave some space and place everything else. Press (T) and wire the ^orange;Terminal^reset; to the ^orange;Controller^reset;.",
   "Place the ^orange;Relay^reset; and connect it in the same way. Now connect the ^blue;Input^reset; from your ^orange;Relay^reset; to the ^orange;storage devices^reset;, your ^orange;Bus^reset; and the ^orange;Drive Bay^reset;. Only use one ^orange;Controller^reset; per Network and connect everything to it! \nCongratulations, you have a complete Transmatter Network!",
   "(b) To use your network, locate the ^orange;Terminal^reset; and press (E). You should see your items in there already, take one with double click or a specific number at the very bottom. You can add items with Shift+L, just like with any other container. \nTo use Advanced Storage put a ^orange;Storage Drive^reset; into the ^orange;Drive Bay^reset;. Any item you throw into the ^orange;Terminal^reset;, will be loaded onto the ^orange;Drive^reset; until it's full. Feel free to take em out to carry around and use in other networks.",
   "(c) You find the ^orange;Customizable Automatic Transmit Network^reset; at the ^orange;Electronics Center^reset; and its respective upgrades, in the first tab. Wiring works just the same but, but Cat Net is decentralized. If there is a power input mentioned on the label, you can toggle it with a switch. Most important: Read the item label! \nThe ^orange;Item Transference Device^reset; sets CAT apart from Startech, which only moves items when inserted. It automatically handles item movement, across storages.",
   "For now, they will simply transfer all items, if not toggled. They only work in one direction, so choose your ^blue;Input^reset; and ^red;Outputs^reset; carefully. \nThe ^orange;Storage Bridge^reset; is similar to the ^orange;Storage Bus^reset;. It looks for the nearest container to itself, measured from center to center. Just plug them into CAT, ITDs or routers. \n^orange;Pumps^reset; and ^orange;Quarries^reset; work out of the box and automatically collect resources.",
   "A ^orange;Quarry^reset; extends 20 blocks to the right, then mines in the area below it. It will also pick up any other item in its way, like chests. A second mode for the pump will be added later. Theoretically they should stop working when they are full, but that's unlikely to happen with 16 slots to fill. \nThe ^orange;Terminal^reset; is slightly different, as you can't store items in it. That's what the ^orange;Grabber^reset; (Foraging Table) is for. The ^orange;Spout^reset; ejects any liquid.",
   "II. (a) The current IDE interface has 2 functions, the slot filter and the item filter. The ^blue;Input^reset; slot filter, let you pick which slots to take from. ^red;Output^reset; slot filtering is included. \nTo filter items you need one to base the filter on. By default, only that item is transmitted. Inv. Logic takes the condition out, inverts it, and makes it a logical AND. In other words, it excludes that item from transmit. There's also filtering for Exact Match, Type Match (Item Category), and Category Match (Groups of Categories).",
   "(c) Thank you for the help, the previous version of the guide and for making FU what it is, Kherae! \nShout out to zetaPRIME(StarTech) and TP!(Steambound Reloaded). And of course Cratesmith(VesselBound) for the Storage Bridges! \nWithout their work we'd still be getting our hands dirty!", 
   "(x) Item Categories: \nGeneric: junk, anything that doesn't fit a category. \nTreasure: Anything shiny or rare. \nMaterials: block, liquid, platform, breakables! \nRail stuff: rail, railplatform, railpoint \nconsumable: the food category. \nbooks: blueprint, codex \nReagents: materials, ingredients, fuel \nbuilding: storage, crafting, electronics, furniture, doors. \nFarm beast and tree stuff \nWeapons \nArmor",
