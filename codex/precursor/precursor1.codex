    "<Thankfully, translators are available for some Precursor language. While still spotty, you can glean that this is an important find. Continuing translation:>",
    "Entry 1: We have at long last ^red;<unknown>^reset; the threshold. Through lacing the singularity with ^red;<unknown>^reset; we have managed to cross through. Without the artifact, this would not have been possible. TK-7A Test subject appears to retain normal faculties. We may finally be able to return to our universe.",
    "Entry 2: Carefully resyncing the ^red;<unknown>^reset; formula has gained us further insight into the new ^red;<unknown>^reset;. The portal, unfortunately, is unstable. Despite our efforts at ^red;<unknown>^reset;, it appears to resist becoming self-sustaining. Unfortunate, but not unexpected.",
    "Entry 3: ^red;<unknown>^reset; the Proletariat! Because of their insistence on experiments, we have ^red;<unknown>^reset; the people! The portal is stable and growing at a geometric rate, but it no longer goes where it should. Nothing seems to affect it. Desperation may soon give way to ^red;<unknown>^reset;.",
    "Entry 4: Should this record reach any species that follows in our footsteps: Do not attempt ^red;<unknown>^reset; at Delta Freya II. This world is tainted, and we dare not share why. Under no circumstances should you explore this world. Doom awaits."
