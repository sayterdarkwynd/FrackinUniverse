    "<Translation: We've discovered a new race that is unlike any we've seen before. They are savage and primitive, far from being capable of posing a threat to the empire. They don't even have a civilization yet. These plant-things wander about in a near constant state of hunger.>",
    "<We continue to monitor these plant-things, and are convinced that they are unable to develop keen intellect without some form of aid. As such, the Overlords have declared them unremarkable. This means exploitation of their world, rather than non-interference, can begin.>",
    "<Interestingly enough, the plant-things are *delicious*. While our own native vegetation is tasty, these bipedal creatures are like a dessert platter. Imagine the most tasty Yulashk you've ever eaten. It's better than that. Note however, that flavor is lost if they are deceased. Enjoy the taste while they are alive.>"
