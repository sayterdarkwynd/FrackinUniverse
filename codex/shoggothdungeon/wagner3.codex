"The find I have just made rewrites the knowledge of the cosmos in its entirety. There are ruins past the mountain. It was a treacherous climb but well worth it. If my initial scans are correct, this site is over 40 million years old.",
"These ruins match no known species, language or style I am aware of. Something about them is wrong, though. The angles are just...off. Dimensions seem larger or smaller than they should. It makes no sense, and it warps my perception to stare at them for any moderate length of time.",
"I think maybe MacReady wasn't as crazy as we thought. I think something was in that corpse I brought back. I found more of these things, and with the tests I ran...well, they're still alive. Somehow, they still function. And one of them is back at the base with everyone else!",
"I wonder how deep these ruins go? I've found a passage down, and find myself in a deep and ancient temple. There is no light to speak of, and utter silence reigns. It's oppressive. But these carvings, this language. Every tile tells a story.",
"There are pictograms on some tiles, giving visual representation of events to some degree. While much is uncertain, there was definitely a civilization here. Their people flourished here and through science birthed a new race. Slaves. But all slaves eventually rebel.",
"These slave beings rose up and slaughtered most of their creators, until a truce was made and the Old Ones left this place save for the few required to keep the Slaves contained. The slave-things are some sort of amorphous, shapeless mass.",
"I've found some sort of liquid pool that is not unlike the waters found outside. Even a slight touch of it makes me feel strange. There's no way forward, so I am going to brave the pool...see what's within. I've jury-rigged a device I hope can protect me from the effects.",
"My mind is slowly falling away and I can feel the bliss of madness knocking at my cerebellum. I won't yet welcome insanity. Not until I've seen the end of this place. I found some sort of combination switch. I'll tinker with it until I can access whatever it protects. I have little choice. I can hear things in the darkness, including gutteral chants in some hideous tongue.",
"No, I will not stop the sweetness or halt the spread of this madness. I feel the need to find It. I have snuck past some horrid sentries and now go to meet with my new God. I can hear it undulating deep below. I will eat its sacrament. I found it anyway, so it's mine and I'm hungry to take what belongs to me.",
"It gave me a most special task. I brought its babies back to share with the others. We can all be perfect together. We can all be as one with the Watcher in the Deep. It will fill us with need and sweet, sweet hunger. Come my friends, let us share in the feast...",
"I should have turned back.I should have turned back.I should have turned back.I should have turned back.I should have turned back.I should have turned back.I should have turned back.I should have turned back.I should have turned back.I should have turned back.I should have turned back.I should have turned back...
