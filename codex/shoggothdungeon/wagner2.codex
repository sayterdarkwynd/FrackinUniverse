"MacReady has been acting strange lately. I can't place my finger on it, but ever since that...thing...fell under his operating knife he's changed. It's unsettling. I think it may be in his eyes. It's almost as if he sees you and...knows you in ways he shouldn't. He even made comments on events in my life he wasn't present for.",

"We found one of the dogs this morning. It had been strung up and vivisected. Its organs were in a neat pile beside it on the floor, stacked to resemble that malign aberration we found in the ice. I suspect MacReady, but nobody has seen him leave his lab in three days.",

"MacReady joined us for breakfast this morning, though all of us were more than a bit unsettled. There were noticable changes in his behavior, especially in regards to social communication. When asked to stop behaving strangely, he savagely lunged at Doakes and attempted to bite him. We had to restrain him to inject him with a sedative.",

"We've confined MacReady to the labs. He's totally lost it. We'd rather risk locking him in the lab with that...thing...than have him trying to attack us. It's safer for everyone this way, and allows us a limited measure of control during this unusual period.",

"We all agreed that I should investigate beyond where we found the thing in the ice. We need to determine if there is anything more to this strangeness beyond the nearby cliffs. I'll need a ^orange;grappling hook of some sort^white; to make any real progress. I'll have Doakes whip one up for me."
