"MacReady has been acting strange lately. I can't place my finger on it, but ever since that...thing...fell under his operating knife he's changed. It's unsettling.",

"Actually, I think it may be in the eyes. It's almost as if he sees you and...knows you. Knows you in ways he shouldn't. He remarked on Doakes's sordid past, and he wasn't there.",

"We found one of the dogs this morning. It had been strung up and vivisected. Its organs were in a neat pile beside it on the floor, stacked to resemble that malign aberration I found.",

"We've confined MacReady to the labs. He's totally lost it. At least we can seal the door remotely and he can be holed up with that...thing. We all decided that I should investigate beyond where I found the thing...see if there is anything more to this strangeness beyond the cliffs. I'll need a ^orange;grappling hook of some sort^white; to make any real progress."
