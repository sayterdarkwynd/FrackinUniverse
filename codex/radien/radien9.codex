"X'i are the subject of my team's focus. Very little is known about them, which only makes them more interesting to study. To be clear: most of us know less than we'd like about them...but more than anyone else does. We do have some speculations not widely accepted or considered by most historians that we'd like to get into if time remains when we're done.",
"Their body chemistry resembles nothing we've seen in our galaxy thus far, with very little affecting their cells - specialized diseases seem one of the few things that have much effect on them. They are silicon based yet contain heavy doses of DNA that resembles the genetic makeup of plants. Their bodies even follow some similar patterns to the plant kingdom: they place a bulb, which grows to maturity. If the conditions are right it will 'hatch' and a new radien could be born.",
"The actual way this happens, unfortunately, eludes us. Their birth rate is extremely low, and no method we have been able to devise is capable of artificially inducing the plant to flower into a new X'i. In fact, most of the time this destabilized the core within the plant. This is a bad thing, as they have a habit of exploding when jostled firmly. When you're not immune to most forms of radiation, this is exceptionally hazardous. My team learned this the hard way, unfortunately. We lost Jeff last week.",
"Anyhow, best not to dwell. He'd have wanted us to continue on. And so we shall: The X'i seem to be able to generate these bulbs on demand (so to speak...) and use them to physically transport their bodies! I've also seen them use the explosive aspect of the bulbs to ward off threats. And that's not all! They are also capable of using pieces of their own body to fashion tools, weapons and who knows what else.",
"Another of their innate capabilities is in forming wads of radioactive spore that a X'ian can physically lob. This is apparently entirely defensive in nature, and was likely utilized in ancient times to incapacitate potential food sources in addition to protecting themselves."
