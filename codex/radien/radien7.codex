"X'i have spent time living around Novakid for longer than any organic race can say. As typical of Novakid, they don't seem to remember much about their relationship with this other race but not one has talked poorly of the X'i. Some have mentioned being fond of a X'ians soft, fluffy feathers. Others say they enjoy the coos a happy X'i makes. Of course,, it isn't prudent to hang around them for long periods of time unless you want to be terminally ill from radiation."
