"Recently, we discovered a massive hologram depicting canid-looking beast well over the size of a planet, tucked in the remains of one of the X'i ghost towns. It barely functioned, but the Ancient tech was resilient enough to withstand the eons since it was last used. When activated, the giant hologram appeared, animating and depicting this canine creature making a blessing motion over a series of eight worlds. Light left its body to infuse each of these eight worlds, and this action repeated approximately every 60 seconds thereafter until we deactivated the device.
We speculate that this is one of the gods they may have worshipped at one point in time. The translation of its name from runes appears to be ^orange;'ORANA'^reset;, if the paper from our X'ian friend is accurate. With only this to work with we have little other choice than to assume it is, at the very least, usable.
The device itself was found while scavenging through a nearly intact X'ian city (if you can call this place a city...I am not sure how best to name it) composed of strange looping patterns of graphite and cobalt merged together to form myriad structures that towered above like skyscrapers but composed of octogonal 'units' that could very well have been individual apartments. What would have passed for windows at some point were now empty portholes devoid of decoration, allowing us to see inside of these strange compartments without much issue. 
Covering nearly all of the structures was a thin layer of an ash-like substance that gave everything the appearance of having been burned in a great conflagration in the ancient past. Samples we took soon dispelled that idea, however. No, instead what we had discovered was a thin film of X'ian remains broken down over millenia into nothing but a fine dust. 
It's sad when you think about it : The collective accomplishments, memories, knowledge, hopes and dreams, children, brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, dreams and aspirations...now nothing but dust.
We explored much of this city, which in total covered more than 30km of territory. Very little was found that could be used or identified due to the fact that the majority of X'ian creations are made *of* X'ians and had long since decayed. As with all previous forays to locate ancient X'ian lore or technology, this trip met with near total failure. Until the last day.

You see, we had stumbled onto what appeared to be an arena or stadium (insofar as its shape was concerned). We had prepared to assume it was nothing but a sporting facility until a curious odor struck us. We felt compelled to investigate. Within, a vast field of 'junk' lay, most of it long since decayed. Despite this, a few pieces were intact. One, a statue composed of greenish stone, about the size of a two men. This statue featured a figure of amorphous aquatic nature squatting horribly on a pedestal of sorts. Adorning this statue was a dense script of characters I had not previously seen. Perhaps the ancient language of the X'i? Maybe this figure was one of their deities!
The second intact object was a small computer-like device smaller than a Tricorder. While non-functioning, was clearly of X'i design (the familiar vine-like style was apparent). It utilized internal parts for computing that bear no resemblance to anything used in the galactic community. Further study revealed it to be a Protein-based computer. This was a momentous discovery...until it began to decay the second we left orbit.
The final object of note was the remains of a single X'i. Resting atop the pile, and clearly killed there, it was unusually intact despite being deceased. Through its torso protruded an enormous spear (length: 3 meters) that anchored it into the refuse pile. It had not reverted to the graphite-like stone typical of their kind, however. It remained pliable as if recently killed. Dating indicated that the figure was more than 200,000 years dead. Upon inspection, the spear returned unusual results: it was made of a strange greenish metal none of us were able to identify. Perhaps whatever this material is prevents the decay of X'i?
