As for the X'i themselves...how they came to be is, strictly speaking, impossible. They remain the only example of life that is silicon-based even being possible! The radioactive bulbs within them are the sentient part of the being, a consciousness contained within. The plant-like outer body is their self, and it hardens over time until calcifying into mineral-hard 'flesh'. Eventually, generally after death, it becomes graphite. Their actual bodies sprout feather-like hair that is both supple and soft. It appears to be highly resistant to radiation (effectively nullifying it).
It is likely the case, then, that without these feathers the X'i would be virtually unable to socialize with the galactic community. Their very presence would make them a hazard to the health of every current intelligent civilization we know about. They pose next to no threat, thankfully, and are valuable members of any team they assist.

While they have issues communicating they are outgoing, personable and always ready to help others. Frankly, it's rare to find a group so collectively pleasant to be around. There's a reason for this, however...See, X'i have exceptionally open dietary needs. They can effectively eat whatever they want to sate their near-constant hunger. You will almost never meet a X'i who is not frequently snacking! Without food their cores begin to die down, and this leads to lethargy, weakness and (as is the case with every other race) eventually death. A side-effect of their constant eating is that a good many food types they enjoy (dirt, especially) possess narcotic-like effects on their moods not unlike heavy dopamines. With their pleasure-centers so easily stimulated, it is easy to see why they are pleasant companions.
Ultimately, the X'i are much closer to an organic-inorganic hybrid...a perfect mix of Silicon and Carbon-based life. A homonculus such as this is surely not a purely natural occurrence. I fail to see how in any natural circumstance this specific coincidence of genetics could occur.

Should anyone find a way to explain it, I'm all ears. Until then, I will have no choice but to assume they are the product of third-party intervention. I believe it most likely that this was during their early development before true sentience had been achieved. As to who made them...who can say? The mysteries of the cosmos are vast and terrifying."
