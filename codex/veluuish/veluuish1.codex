    "The Kir'vat are a faction made up of artisans, scholars and artisans, their burning curiosity drives them to pursue knowledge above all else, to the point that it can sometimes lead them into trouble. They travel the galaxy and set up temporary outposts to complete a new vein of research before moving on again. They are naturally optimistic, see a silver lining in everything and are always willing to lend a hand to help those in need."
