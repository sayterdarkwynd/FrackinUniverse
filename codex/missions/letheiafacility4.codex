Please note that Friday is sushi appreciation day. This is an event organised by management to help non-Hylotl staff better appreciate the roots of our company culture and bond with their fellow employees. Non-essential staff are welcome to take a half-day in the afternoon to attend this excellent event and enjoy themselves.",

"As Letheia employs a large percentage of non-Hylotl staff, we are dedicated to introducing our diverse and womenderful workforce to the joys of Hylotl culture, which many across the universe have enthusiastcally embraced, especially the humans. A screening of the traditional Hylotl favourite, Numi and the Giant Mecha, will be open to all facility staff from 7 pm onwards.",

"While attendance is not mandatory, we sincerely hope that all facility staff will not shame themselves and attend this glorious event which management has carefully put together for your enjoyment. We hope to keep employee morale in good shape, especially considering the unfortunate events of the last three weeks."
