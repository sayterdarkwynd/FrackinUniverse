"INCIDENT REPORT #14590

Specimen J-11 has been confirmed missing from the lab. We're all fairly puzzled - even if it did break out of its capsule, someone had to have deactivated the security system in order to open the doors for it to escape. I can personally account for everyone with the security codes that night, as they were all at the sushi-appreciation event.",

"We haven't been able to pinpoint its exact location, but all signs appear to point to it escaping towards, for some reason, an amusement park. I don't think J-11 is traceable back to us in any way, so it's just a write-off - I'll just let those protectorate do-gooders take care of the problem once the inevitable starts.",

"To be honest, I'm kind of glad it's no longer our problem. J-11 was rather unnerving - I know some of the research associates claim it had been developing some form of sapience, but we all know that's nonsense. Senior management has assured us that they'll deal with the problem, and to get on with our work. I'm inclined to agree."
