        "Among the races in the galactic core, few are as capable of beautiful song as the Peglaci. Their people have honed their vocal cords over millenia into some of the most advanced sound-making organs known to science. They are capable of reaching a stunning 15 to 40 octave range, depending on their familial heritage!",
        "This means that they are often capable of vibrating their vocal cords at frequencies most species are not even able to hear. Their 'songs' are even capable of calming others if they can find the right frequency. This has led to some unique talents among professionals of their species.",
        "Take, for example, Madame Knoshik of the Gurula Gentleman's Ranch. She uses her song to draw in suitors to her establishment over a distance of 0.25 light years thanks to state-of-the-art speakers on the exterior. She also uses this voice to keep her clients calm and well-behaved. A boon to her women-in-waiting.",
        "Then of course there is Vorlin Tae, reknowned opera Diva. She has performed to audiences across the galaxy, and many claim her shows are more intoxicating than even the most expensive street drugs. Her voice is the stuff of legends and tickets are appropriately priced for such a reputation.",
        "Another fine example would be the Hevlar Corps, an elite branch of the Protectorate Defense Force composed entire of Peglaci. Through special sound-based training they are capable of eliminating threats without even needing to shoot. Soothing targets to sleep, and then imprisoning them, is much cleaner than wet works.",
        "There are so many other potential applications for their voices that we've likely barely scratched the surface of what is possible."
