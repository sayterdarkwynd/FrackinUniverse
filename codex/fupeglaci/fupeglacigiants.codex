        "The Wanderers have left traces of themselves across the entire galaxy - many or most have been lost to time or salvage, but you may encounter them in your travels. Most, sadly, will scoff at you and call you a liar. Few believe anything predates the Ancients, after all. Yet, if that were not the case, explain our history?",

        "The Artifacts are of great value, but they are also almost indestructible - you won't be breaking them by accident, don't worry. They're easy to identify, given the distinct black metal and glowing yellow inset details. If you encounter them, return them to a Peacekeeper outpost for a finder's fee. It will pay even more than tech from the Ancients!",
	
	"Alternately, you may wish to try to use them. You are free to try, but we would suggest you be very cautious. Some Peglaci settlements contain a Wanderer artifact or two - you may have the most luck if you start there."
