    "For the most part, every known species that has reached the stars has, at some point in their history, believed in some form of deity. Only one known exception exists among organics: The Kirhos. No documented records exist of deification of the sun, moon, or any other force in their ancient past and even their leadership was only ever treated with respect (and not, like most races, veneration and God-status).",

This lack of ability to accept fanciful notions has resulted in centuries of cultural adversity when dealing with the Avian people."
