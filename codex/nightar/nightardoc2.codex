  "This tome details the importance of swords among the Nightar people, circa their Classical era (dated to approximately 2,300 years ago) up to their Imperial era (1,223 years).",
  "With a homeworld sparse in strong metals, the dawning of warfare saw swords reach a value far beyond that of nearly any known culture (historically speaking, even including Humanity, nothing comes close!). Finding enough metal with which to form long-lasting blades was expensive, and led to a strong cultural importance to swords.",
  "It was beleived that a warrior and his blade were forever bound, and drew strength and power from one another (and could transfer this power back and forth, often observed in ancient rituals known as Conshak). A warrior either passed his weapon on to his child, or was buried with the weapon should no heirs remain to inherit the strength of their father. To take anothers blade was a 'shameful act' practiced only by desperate cowards or outcasts.",
  "Some blades would pass for hundreds (perhaps even thousands) of years from one hand to the next within a single family (or be won in duels or by war). Even today some swords can be traced back nearly five thousand years! Most of this age have long since passed the point of usefulness due to the natural process of aging or by excessive use in battle. These pieces are largely symbolic in importance, and in many cases are a mark of nobility.",
  "Every single heirloom blade has one thing in common: A name. If a Nightar carries a sword for longer than a few battles, you can be certain it has been named during a Conshak. Swords permeate many aspects of Nightar society. Duels of leadership are (strangely) still common to this day, and despite advances and exposure to countless",
  "other species among the stars they are still quite happy with monarchy as their form of government. The Kingsryche, a ritual of sorts to determine Kingship (Royal Blood is a concept long-eschewed in their system of law), is rendered 'false' unless each contender possesses an adequately smithed (and blooded) blade. This ritual calls on every male that reaches adulthood (14 is considered Adult age among the Nightar) to meet in a designated arena.",
  "Each will meet with swords drawn. Only he who is unscathed and victorious shall be named King. Should no victor emerge (any wound renders you an immediate loser) then the Kingsryche is attempted each day until such time as a new Heptarch can be crowned. Should his rule prove to be a failure, he will eventually be challenged and deposed",
  "by another. Should he be defeated, it is tradition that he is beheaded by his own blade to echo the shame of his poor rule. The new ruler then takes over, and society carries on. Such is the way of honor. Wounds suffered by Nightar heal in the form of strange scars that seep a black, inky shadow. Known as Tenshae, these are viewed as badges of honor and prowess among warriors.",
  "Those with the most Tenshae are often seen as Champions of the people, for they bear the most signs of mastery in combat."
