"Where did the Nightar develop such overwhelming fear of the unknown, and light? While it is true that there is precedent due to their rather unfortunate reaction to direct sunlight (its lethal to several branches of their lineage, though merely toxic and causes reactions similar to anaphylaxis in most),",
"it is unlikely that this would cause a gross cultural terror of the level we see. Instead, I posit that some form of atmospheric effect, perhaps unique to their homeworld, is responsible. Perhaps during their planets history, a hole in the ozone formed. If this were the case, and the planetary rotation led",
"to this hole moving across the heavens to shine upon the world below, there would be a concentrated beam of light that could quite literally scorch entire regions on a seasonal basis. The effect this would have on culture and development is beyond doubt, as it would also render the surface nearly unlivable.",
"Imagine having a surface city on a Penumbra planet that would be scorched to cinders every season? Yet if this were the case it would give reason to flee underground and never return."
