   "The Nightar are actually pre-disposed to extreme xenophobia at the genetic level. They fear the unknown in ways we don't fully understand. Imagine what it is to hate and fear the sun! It is in our ignorance of that life that the Nightar gain their power in the political spectrum. Their dislike of the light keeps them well away from affairs of state for other species. Instead, they take on a more Espionage-oriented roles. At home in the dark, they excel at stealth in ways the rest of us simply cannot match. This has led to them knowing many secrets of the various players in galactic politics...",
