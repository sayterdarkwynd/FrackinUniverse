  "The homeworld of the unusual race known as the Pharitu is a hostile and hellish place, where survival on the surface is nearly impossible for any other known intelligent species. Extremophiles able to withstand vast electric discharges fatal to most species are the",
  "only real exception to this, and even they have issues with the atmospheric conditions. In fact, so hostile is the environment that even the Pharitu themselves stick to subterranean regions except during very specific weather conditions (more on this later, as this is an entire",
