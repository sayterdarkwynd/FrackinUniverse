  "A Pharitu in ancient times almost never stopped moving, due in part to tectonic plate movements but primarily as a result of magma flowing at nearly every strata of the planets crust. They were instead almost constantly burrowing, digging",
  "through solid rock psionically or ingesting it as they went along in order to sustain themselves. Their minds possess exceptional powers capable of projecting through most stone when fueled by energy from their Shakta, the natural gem formations that",
  "contain the essence which fuels their lives. Through this energy they can 'cut' into stone, allowing them the ability to shape it as no other known species can."
