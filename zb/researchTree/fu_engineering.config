You can ^green;Research^reset; one later, or use the one at the ^orange;Outpost^reset;).\n\nMechs will provide a large amount of damage resistance and help you stay alive for longer in harsh situations, and are able to ^green;Fly^reset; in an atmosphere as well as space.\n\nIf you're having trouble finding ^orange;Core Fragments^reset;, just dig towards the planet core.
