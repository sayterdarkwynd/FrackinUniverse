BTW Sayter, its possible to set up scan specific actions that do not interact with the scanned object.
Two options depending on needs:

- The handler generates and keeps track of a table that holds an object name, and a function to call. Once that object is scanned, the function is called. Can be single use, can be infinite.
Useful for when you want global stuff to happen like scan Apex statue to get 200 research and can mimic vanilla quests.

- The handler sends a message to all objects in a radius when scanning an object. There will have to be another object that catches those messages and does stuff based on that.
Useful for variable, area specific stuff where you'd have sort of a combination lock or a hidden button.
Like entering a room would make the listener object pick a random object in the room, and will require you to scan it
