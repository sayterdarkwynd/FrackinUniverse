Peter Crowley - amazing music!
Cat Face - Scripted Artificial Intelligence Lattice (Customisable A.I.!), used the SAIL back panel rendering code

and many others who've contributed in some fashion or another, or had their mods featured in FU.
While most of the content is my own, their own content is also included in various areas.
So thanks, guys! FU wouldn't be where it is without you guys too!
