^orange;-----     1.04a    -----^reset;
> Fixed a bug that prevented using AI chips from Scripted SAIL
> Non-existant chips will no longer prevent SAIL from working (This means you can safely uninstall Scripted SAIL and any AI chip mods)

^orange;-----     1.04     -----^reset;
> Removed a log print in the music player
> Fixed music player missing particles after its reloaded while playing music.
> Fixed the list inside the missions menu overlaying the main/secondary buttons when clicking reply

> Rewrote 'textTyper.lua' 'scrambling' function to use a string instead of a table (usage unchanged)
> Added missing comments regarding text scrambling in 'textTyper.lua'

^orange; Note regarding ASCII characters:^reset;
The reason I'm not fixing textTyper to work for non-ASCII characters (like O's with dots above them or Japanease characters) is because its not worth the effort.
Just don't use language modifying SAIL chips if you have Scripted SAIL installed and you're good.

> Fixed a typo preventing the update window from working

^orange;-----     1.03     -----^reset;
> Updated the math.clamp function inside zb_util.lua

> Fixed the 'next' button not being disabled when there's only one thing displayed and the player called the pane.

     ^green;Music Player:^reset;
> Added a wall mounted variant
> Added recipes for the object, the wall mounted object, and the portable item. Recipe is unlocked by iron bar, and crafted at the EPP section of the anvil.
> Multiple music players can be wired to each other so that changing/stopping music in one, does it for all the wired instances. Same applies to toggling the label.
> Can be now used as a switch. Treated like a lever set to 'on' when music is playing, and vice versa.
> You can now set their music playing range to 10, 20, 30, or 40. Default is 30.

> Opening the window manually via SAIL or quickbar no longer applies the wait timer/requires to view all mods
> Updated its description so people know its there so they know when a mod is updated. (As if anyone reads that anyways lel)
> Cleaned up some leftovers

     ^green;Research System:^reset;
> Fixed a bug with researches trying to unlock multiple blueprints but ends up crashing instead
> Info panel now has a slider for when you need a loooooooooooooot of text
> Research will now display unlocked item blueprints (if there are any)
> This option can be disabled by setting the 'hideUnlocks' tag to true in a researches definition
> Updated the documentation to reflect that change

^orange;-----     1.01     -----^reset;
> Fixed broken SAIL interface by adding missing script (Which already exists in FU)
> Fixed script inconsistency between ZBs and FUs research panel
> Fixed research panel not registering currency as currency

> Fixed Quickbar issue (I think?)

Welcome to ^orange;Ztarbound^reset;; A mod that aims to improve some of the untouched by mods vanilla aspects and add some more tools for modders to play with!

^orange;Updated to 1.04h:^reset;
^green;>^reset; Another small fix, relating to 1.4

This window, added by this mod, is here to notify you when a mod (using this feature) was updated, as well as guide new and old users through some basic mod info and important changes, including, but not limited to, changelogs, extra information, and credits.*

Normally, these windows cannot be closed instantly when called by a mods update, a newly created character(Because of limitations), or when installing a new mod.

But don't worry, if only one mod is updated/added, you can close the window after a short timer that appears in the bottom left corner.**

If multiple mods were updated/added, the pane will be closeable after you've viewed all the mods.** (Via the 'previous'/'next' buttons)

You can open this window manually through SAIL, or the quickbar. (provided by StardutLib/QuickbarMini)

Want your mod to use this feature? Not a problem! Head on to the 'Information' tab, you'll find everything you need there.

Be advised - This mod is integrated into Frackin' Universe, and does not require the standalone version. If you have the standalone version installed alongside FU, remove the standalone version as to not slow down Starbounds loading time, and to prevent potential issues.

Thanks, and have fun! :)

* - The information provided depends on whether the mod in question is using this feature, and the info itself is provided by said mods author.

** - Technically, you CAN close the window, but it'll re-open itself, and reset the timer. :) 
",



	"credits" : "
- ^orange;Sayter^reset; - Original UI designer
- ^orange;[fox emoji]^reset; - Some scripts for the new SAIL, and scan-for-blueprint used as base for scan-interaction
- ^orange;Hubnester^reset; + ^orange;Lucca^reset; - Original creators of the FU music player

Welcome to ^orange;Ztarbound^reset;; A mod that aims to improve some of the untouched by mods vanilla aspects and add some more tools for modders to play with!

^red;NOTE:^reset; Ztarbound is already built into Frackin' Universe, so there's no point in having them both installed.

Ztarbound does not add any content of its own (Other than a few things), as its aim is to add features instead of content.
Some of those feature are...

^green; - Update Info Window -^reset;
Unless constantly keeping track of installed mods, players have no proper way of telling whether something updated. Especially if they have a lot of mods installed.
This window aims to fix that by popping up whenever a mod is updated, displaying some information about the mod, as well as a changelog.

^green; - Research System -^reset;
A system that gives the option to organize progression in a more strict fashion, and preventing the player from getting lost in a sea of content.
Using this, you can lock blueprints behind research with varying prices, trigger certain events, or even make a skill tree!

^green; - Questlist -^reset;
An organized place to view lists of quests and their requirements.
Useful for tutorials, storylines, or just making a 'to-do' list.

^green; - Scan Interactions -^reset;
Ever wanted to hide a button from the infamous 'alt' key?
Or maybe make your our scan quests?
Maybe an object that displays dynamic data?
Well this addition adds the option to set up a 'what happens when this object is scanned' function!

^green; - New SAIL -^reset;
Not only did SAIL get a new look, but it now comes with a handful of extra options!
View currencies added by other mods that cannot be viewed on the inventory pane.
Missions are split to main and secondary, as well as displaying which missions are replays.
And the option to add your own functions to SAIL.
Fully compatible with Scripted SAIL.
^red;NOTE:^reset; If you're using a custom race, you must install the race patch which is linked on Ztarbounds mod page.
^red;NOTE:^reset; If you want a custom SAIL, install the scripted SAIL mod and the chip for the custom AI version you want.

^green; - FU's Music Player -^reset;
Now in standalone version, and with an easier method of adding music!
Can even make your own addon for personal use with ease!
Craftable at the anvil, under the EPP section.

^green; - Utility + Example Scripts -^reset;
There are some scripts which can help with making a text be typed out instead of appearing instantly, fading hex colors, rolling dice, and more!
And some example for setting up your own things, such a function upon leaving/entering a world.

^green; - And more to come! -^reset;

Documentation for using these feature can be found inside the '_doc' folder on the Github repo of this mod.
You can find the link to it on Ztarbounds mod page.

^green;Questions? Complaints? Suggestions? Random chit-chat?^reset;
You can reach me via Discord. Link is posted on Ztarbounds mod page.
